# ADBC Snowflake driver + shim (ADBC-SHIM). Kept in its own stage so the
# compiler never reaches the runtime image and so a broken driver/shim pair
# fails the BUILD. Removal: see packages/server/adbc-shim/README.md.
#
# Downloaded directly rather than through the upstream installer's `curl … | sh`,
# and checked against the digest GitHub publishes: this is a 16MB native library
# dlopen'd into the server process, and a version tag is mutable — an asset can
# be re-uploaded under it. Pin the bytes, not the name.
#
# No `|| echo` fallback, unlike the extension install in base-deps: a failed
# fetch FAILS THE BUILD. That tolerance is exactly what let this ship broken
# once. An image without the driver cannot answer a single Snowflake query and
# must not leave the builder reporting success.
#
# The shim (packages/server/adbc-shim/) is compiled here and installed under the
# driver's own file name, with the real driver renamed beside it; selftest.c
# dlopens the pair the way the driver manager will and fails the build if the
# chain does not come up. No network, no credentials.
#
# When bumping DUCKDB_VERSION, re-check this: the community extension moves with
# DuckDB and the driver ABI may move with it, and a mismatch surfaces only at
# query time.
# Same base as `final` ON PURPOSE: `-ldl` binds the shim's dlopen to this
# glibc (dlopen@GLIBC_2.34), and the selftest below runs against THIS libc. A
# final stage on a different base would pass the selftest here and fail to load
# the shim at runtime, where only smoke-test 4b would notice. Change both or
# neither.

# The Snowflake extension is a wrapper over the ADBC Snowflake driver, and
# `INSTALL snowflake FROM community` does NOT bring it — the extension ships
# alone, the driver is a separate artifact. Without it the extension installs,
# LOADs and answers snowflake_version() perfectly well, and then every
# snowflake_query() fails at run time with "ADBC Snowflake driver
# (libadbc_driver_snowflake.so) not found".
#
# The driver is downloaded, verified and wrapped in the `adbc-driver` stage
# above; what arrives here is two files (ADBC-SHIM — without the shim it is the
# one upstream file under its own name):
#
#   libadbc_driver_snowflake.so       the shim (packages/server/adbc-shim/), which
#                                     forwards every call to the real driver and
#                                     sets the two statement options that bound
#                                     the driver's read-ahead — see its README
#   libadbc_driver_snowflake.real.so  the upstream driver, unmodified
#
# The shim finds the real driver beside itself, so both go wherever the
# extension is. Placed HERE, after the extensions COPY above, rather than
# earlier: the extension resolves the driver by calling dladdr on ITSELF and
# looking beside the loaded object, so the driver has to sit next to whichever
# snowflake.duckdb_extension the runtime actually loads. That directory is
# discovered rather than reconstructed from a platform string — the CLI
# (base-deps) and the bake (@duckdb/node-api, in the builder) each write their
# own, and this is the layer that ships.
#
# The closing count-match is the verification — one shim and one real driver
# for EVERY extension directory, not "at least one somewhere": a pipeline's
# status is its last command's, so a copy that failed in a non-final loop
# iteration would otherwise pass. snowflake_version() cannot serve as a check,
# being a scalar that never touches the driver.
