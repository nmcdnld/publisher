# Release Notes

Curated release notes for `@malloy-publisher/sdk`, `@malloy-publisher/app`, and `@malloy-publisher/server` (versioned in lockstep).

## How this file is used

The `Release (NPM + Docker)` workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) creates GitHub releases automatically with a standard header (NPM/Docker links) plus an auto-generated "What's Changed" PR list via `gh release create --generate-notes`. That auto list is sufficient for routine patch releases.

For releases that warrant narrative — redesigns, breaking changes, migration steps — write a `## [Unreleased]` section below, in the PR that changes the behaviour. **The release workflow does almost all of the rest**: `gh-release` appends every `[Unreleased]` section to the release page alongside the generated PR list, then pushes a `release-notes-stamp-<version>` branch restamping those headings with the version that shipped them. Nothing to paste, and nothing to remember while writing.

One step is a human's, and it is the one that bites when it is skipped: someone has to open that branch as a PR and merge it. `main` requires a pull request, so the release cannot land the stamp itself, and the job summary prints the link. Until it merges the headings still read `[Unreleased]`, which is exactly what the _next_ release matches — so the narrative here lands on that release's page too, and on every one after it. Whoever cuts the release owns that click; the `publisher-release` skill makes it a step.

Both steps handle several sections, which matters because unrelated narratives accumulate between releases: they are separate entries in the same release rather than alternatives. That is precisely what the old manual process got wrong. It also simply stopped happening — 0.0.243 through 0.0.247 each shipped with none of their narrative, and the pages were backfilled by hand afterwards.

Give the heading a title — `## [Unreleased] — what changed`, with an em dash, a colon or a hyphen. The version is already the release's own title, so the marker is stripped and the title is what appears on the page; a bare `## [Unreleased]` has nothing to put there and fails CI on the PR that writes it.

Two consequences worth knowing. A section merged to `main` ships in the **next** release, whenever that is, so do not write one for work that has not landed. And a heading already stamped with a version is history: a follow-up that changes that behaviour opens a **new** `[Unreleased]` section referencing the shipped version by number, rather than editing the old one.

## Packages that version on their own line

`@malloy-publisher/skills` and `@malloy-publisher/create-malloy-package` are not part of the lockstep version above, and their notes do not belong in this file. The release workflow still publishes them: for each one it reads the version from `main` and, when that version is not yet on npm, dispatches that package's own publish workflow (`skills-npm.yml`, `create-malloy-package-npm.yml`). A package whose version is unchanged is skipped, so a release that touched neither is unaffected.

To ship one of them, bump its `package.json` on `main` and run an ordinary release. The bump is what triggers the publish and nothing else in CI requires it, so a change that lands without one is skipped and the release stays green. A prerelease skips both packages outright, since their own versions carry no hyphen and would take over the `latest` tag. Either way the release's job summary says what it skipped and why. Each package can also still be published on its own by dispatching its workflow directly, which is the point of keeping them separate: a skill edit should not need a server release.

One behaviour change to know about: `skills-npm.yml` now publishes only from `main`, matching the guard `create-malloy-package-npm.yml` already had. Dispatching it from a branch still runs `check_pack`, but the publish job is skipped, and a skipped job reports success, so check the job list rather than the run's green tick if you expected a publish. See [.github/workflows/CONTEXT.md](.github/workflows/CONTEXT.md) for the publishing rules that are easy to get wrong.

## [Unreleased] — an HTML data app can draw in its host's light/dark mode and theme

**`/sdk/publisher.js` now tells a page which appearance to draw in.** It sets
`data-theme="light"|"dark"` and `color-scheme` on `<html>`, following the OS
setting standalone. Inside a host that sends its theme, it follows the host
instead: it sets `data-theme-source="host"` and one `--publisher-<token>` custom
property per token sent (`background`, `foreground`, `card`, `primary`,
`chart-1`, ...), exposes the result as `Publisher.theme`, and fires a
`publisher:theme` window event on every change so a page can repaint its canvas
charts. The SDK's `DataAppViewer` now sends the Publisher theme, or the one in
its new `theme` prop, and `useDataAppThemeBridge` does the same for any iframe.
[docs/html-data-apps.md](docs/html-data-apps.md#theme) has the contract.

**Nothing existing changes.** A page that does not style on these attributes
looks as it did. The `questionable-football` and `signals-research` example
packages use them.

## [Unreleased] — a finding can be saved into its package as a data app

**A package can now hold a saved finding: an analysis or a report, written as a
data app under `public/apps/<slug>/`.** The app is two files. `app.json` is a
manifest carrying the narrative, the Malloy behind each chart, and the rows the
finding was written against; `index.html` is a generated stub that loads
`/sdk/publisher-app.js`, a new script the server serves beside `/sdk/publisher.js`.
That renderer is built from the destination's own components, so the standalone
page draws the finding exactly as the insight it was saved from: the same
compound visuals, chart programs and report blocks. The Console lists and opens one like any other data app, with no change to the
Console. Its numbers are live and its prose is pinned: each query runs when the
page opens, and the page falls back to the saved rows, saying so and why, when a
query fails, returns no rows where the finding had some, or lacks a column the
finding used. [docs/html-data-apps.md](docs/html-data-apps.md#manifest-backed-apps-a-saved-finding)
has the format; `examples/storefront/public/apps/revenue-growth-by-year/` is one.

**Writing one goes through `PUT /api/v0/environments/{env}/packages/{pkg}/data-apps/{slug}`**,
with `GET` to read the manifest and its `contentHash` and `DELETE ?expectedHash=`
to remove it. The rules match the dashboard write: omit `expectedHash` to create
(409 if the slug exists), pass it to replace (409 if the file changed since you
read it), 403 under `frozenConfig`. One rule is new: every query in the manifest
is compiled against the target package before anything is written, and the save
is refused with 400 and each failure when one does not compile there. A finding
therefore saves only into the package its data came from. Like every other route
the write is unauthenticated, and `author` in the manifest is whatever the client
sent, so put the gateway in front before exposing it
([docs/security-posture.md](docs/security-posture.md)).

**Nothing existing changes.** A hand-written HTML data app is untouched, and
`public/apps/` is only a convention: a directory there without an `app.json` is
an ordinary data app. For a server build from a clone, `bun run build` now also
builds the renderer bundle; until it has, `/sdk/publisher-app.js` answers 404.

## [Unreleased] — a reloaded package keeps its warm semantic index, and `embeddingIndex.status` means what it says

**Reloading a package no longer costs you a lexically-ranked answer.** A reload
never dropped a package's vectors — they are keyed by package name in
`publisher.db` — but it did throw away the server's record that they were
current, because that record was tied to the in-memory package object a reload
replaces. So the first `get_context` after every `reload_package`, every REST
`?reload=true`, and every watch-mode save was ranked lexically while the server
re-checked hashes that all still matched. If you author models with watch mode
on, that was one degraded answer per save, including saves that changed nothing
relevant. Now a reload whose files hash the same keeps the warm index and is
ranked semantically on its first call; an edit still re-embeds, and still only
the parts whose text changed.

**`embeddingIndex.status` keeps its name and changes its basis, so read this if
you poll it.** On the package resource
(`GET /api/v0/environments/{env}/packages/{pkg}`), `ready` used to be derived
from whether cached rows covered the package's current entity *names*. Vectors
outlive a restart and a reload, so that reported `ready` immediately — while the
next question was still answered lexically. Anything following the documented
"poll until `ready` before measuring retrieval quality" could therefore measure a
lexical run and record it as a semantic one, which is a wrong number rather than
a slow start. `ready` now means one thing: the index is warm, so the next
`get_context` question about this package is ranked semantically. It is decided
by the same completed sync the search path itself gates on. It describes the
index, not the next response — a question whose own query embedding fails still
falls back, with `retrieval_reason: provider-error`.

**What to do.** If you poll for readiness, keep polling `status` — it is now
accurate, and it is the field to trust. If you instead inferred readiness from
`embeddedEntities == totalEntities`, stop: those count coverage by entity name,
so they can be equal while `status` is `indexing` (an edit that rewrote every
doc without renaming anything leaves each entity holding its stale name vector).
Expect `status` to read `indexing` in two places it previously read `ready`:
just after a server restart, until the first question re-establishes the sync,
and after a doc-only edit. Both clear on the next `get_context` question.
Because only a question starts the sync, poll in this order: send the package one
`get_context` question, then poll until `ready`. That holds after every restart,
not only for a package nothing has queried. A script that polls before asking
anything never sees `ready`.

**If your embedding provider ignores `EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS`, the coverage counts
now match reality.** The `dims` column records the length the provider actually
returned, and some providers (Ollama among them) ignore the requested value.
`embeddedRows` and `embeddedEntities` were counted against the *configured*
value instead, so for those providers they read 0 while retrieval was reading
those same vectors happily — and that also pinned `status` at `indexing`. Both
now count on the same rule the sync uses to decide a row is current: the current
model, any vector length.

That makes them a count of what is cached, not a prediction of what a search can
read — the scan also matches on vector length, which only a real question knows.
So after a change to `EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` that no question has probed yet, the
old rows are still counted until the next search discards them. `status` is
already `indexing` throughout that window, which is why it, and not the counts,
is the field to poll.

Unrelated to the above, and unchanged: `--init` still drops the vector cache
along with the rest of persisted storage. It resets the server root, and it
remains the reclaim path for rows orphaned by a configuration change.

## [Unreleased] — a given the query reads is no longer silently replaced by its default

Publisher withholds a given the entry model doesn't surface when a gate is the only thing reading
it, so the gate can still evaluate. It also withheld it when the query itself read a given of the
same name, such as a `where:` on a source from another file that declares its own defaulted
`HIDE`. That `where:` then ran at its default: a caller who sent `HIDE: us-west` got the rows for
`'none'`, with no error. The value is now forwarded, so the request returns a 400 (`unknown given
'HIDE'`), the same as for any given the entry model doesn't surface. **Behavior change:** a
request that used to return rows at the default now fails with a 400. To fix the model, import the
given at the entry model.

## [0.8.2] — the model Explorer takes givens

The Console's model Explorer now shows a **Parameters** row when the model declares givens, and
sends the values with every Run. Before this, a source gated with `#(authorize)` on a given could
not be explored from the Console at all: the Explorer had no way to supply the value, the server
answered 403, and the Explorer showed nothing.

- The values live in the page URL, so a parameterized exploration is a shareable link (the page's
  copy-link button now carries them too).
- A blank given with a default runs, and the result says which default it used. When a query is
  refused and a given with no default was left blank, the results pane names it.
- Query errors, including a 403 from a gate, now show in the results pane instead of vanishing.
- **Explore from here** on a dashboard and a notebook cell's **Data sources** dialog open the
  Explorer with the document's current values rather than none.

No server or API change: the Explorer sends givens through the same `POST …/query` field notebooks
and dashboards use. See [docs/explorer.md](docs/explorer.md#parameters).

## [0.8.2] — notebook cells receive only the givens in their own scope

A notebook cell now ignores a given the notebook declares only in a later cell.
Previously any code cell that ran before the notebook's `import` of a given 400'd
with `unknown given` when the caller sent that given, which is what the Publisher
UI and a router injecting trusted givens both do. A given the cell's own imports
declare is still forwarded, and a name declared nowhere in the notebook still 400s.

## [0.8.1] (BREAKING) — dashboards and notebooks read only what `index.malloy` exports

A package's surface is now the one list of what anyone can read, through every route. An agent
querying `index.malloy`, a dashboard tile, and a notebook cell see the same sources. This reverses
two pieces of 0.7.0 advice: you no longer need `explores` to serve dashboards, and the opt-out is no
longer `"explores": []`.

**Every dashboard is listed.** In 0.7.0 a root `index.malloy` withheld every dashboard, and the fix
was an `explores` listing `index.malloy` and each dashboard file. Now each tagged `dashboards/*.malloy`
is served whatever the surface is. Its tiles, its single query, and its filters' `suggest` read only
what the surface publishes. A source the dashboard declares on top of a published one
(`source: big_orders is orders extend { ... }`) can be read; one over a hidden source cannot. A tile
over a hidden source answers 404, and the load warns once per tile:

```
Tile orders_staging -> by_flag on dashboard overview reads orders_staging, which index.malloy doesn't export, so it won't load. Fix: add orders_staging to the export { ... } in index.malloy.
```

In a package that gates anything with `#(authorize)`, the warning says "a source" rather than naming
it, the same way the query's own 404 does.

What can break:

- **A dashboard file no longer admits anything of its own.** Its `export { ... }` and its own named
  queries used to make a hidden source queryable, even under a written `explores`. They don't now,
  so a tile that relied on that answers 404 and is named in the warnings. Export the source from
  `index.malloy` (or from a file `explores` lists).
- **Dashboards `explores` left out on purpose are now listed**, with their givens and filter names.
  To hide one, remove its `# artifact` tag, and take it out of `explores` if that lists it: an
  untagged file `explores` lists is published like any other model, as before.
- **Every dashboard file is now a query path, and the check is on the source a query runs.** Any
  caller can send query text to `…/models/dashboards/<name>.malloy/query`, not only its tiles.
  `run: secret` there answers 404, and so does a query over a published source that joins a hidden
  source the dashboard file imports:
  `run: orders extend { join_one: s is secret on id = s.id } -> { group_by: s.x }`, the same as a
  query sent to `index.malloy` (see the caller-join section below). Only tiles are checked at load;
  other query text on the dashboard path is checked when it runs.

**A model off the surface answers 404 when read, not only when queried.** `GET …/models/{path}`
used to return any file, with its full compiled model and its text. Now a file off the surface gets
the same 404 the query route gives. Files it does return carry only the names they publish:
`modelDef.contents` and `exports`, `modelInfo`, `sources` and `sourceInfos` are limited to them, so
`index.malloy`'s own response no longer includes the sources it imports and hides. A join to a hidden
source keeps its name and its fields' names and types, which is what querying through it needs, but
not the hidden source's table, SQL or connection. `sourceText` is left out when the text names a
source the file does not publish, backticked names included. A dashboard's text is always returned,
because the Console's dashboard editor saves with it. The editor now builds its field list from the
published models rather than from the files a dashboard imports. None of this applies with no surface
or under `queryableSources: "all"`.

**Notebook cells are held to the surface.** A cell used to run whatever its notebook imported, so
`GET …/notebooks/{path}/cells/{i}` returned rows from a source `index.malloy` hides. Now a cell over a
hidden source answers 404, and 404 rather than 403 when the source is also gated. A source an earlier
cell derives from a published one still works. The notebook GET and the cell response list only the
sources the notebook may read, and the notebook GET leaves out `queryInfo` for a cell that would be
refused, since its schema lists the columns the hidden source returns. A cell's own source over a raw table (`duckdb.table(...)`,
`duckdb.sql(...)`) has no published source under it, so on a curated package it answers 404 too.

**Every use of `explores` is deprecated, and every warning is two sentences.** `explores` still works
as before: the files it lists are listed and queryable, and what they export is the surface, wherever
they live. The one change is a tagged dashboard it lists, which reads the surface and adds nothing to
it (see above). A root `index.malloy` with no keys, the recommended shape, gets no warning at all. Each other warning says what is wrong in
this package, then `Fix:` and the one edit:

| `publisher.json` | Warning |
| --- | --- |
| `explores` naming files | Deprecated. Fix: import those files into `index.malloy`, export what you publish, delete `explores`. Entries for `index.malloy` and dashboards need no replacement. |
| `explores: []` beside `index.malloy` | Deprecated. To publish everything, rename `index.malloy`, point any import of it at the new name, and delete `explores`. |
| `explores: []` alone | Does nothing. Delete it. |
| `queryableSources: "declared"` | Does nothing. Delete it. |
| `queryableSources: "all"` | No warning, as in 0.7.0. The key is still deprecated, but nothing replaces `"all"`: it is the one way to hide an `#(authorize)`-gated source from listings while authorized callers still query it by name. |
| `Index.malloy` (any other case) | Ignored: only a root file named exactly `index.malloy` decides what is published. |

Renaming `index.malloy` is now the way to leave a package uncurated. The caveat from 0.7.0 still
holds: a file that imports `"index.malloy"` fails to compile after the rename, and the compile error
names it. Nothing is removed in this release; both keys still work.

**Unchanged:** materialization and pre-aggregation builds ignore the surface, so a hidden `#@ persist`
intermediate is still built and an exported source still reads its table. `/compile` and MCP
`compile_model` stay exempt. The check is on what a query runs, so a query over a published source
can still join a hidden source its file can see. The surface decides what is listed and queryable by
name; `#(authorize)` is what decides who may read a source.

## [0.8.1] — a join written in query text is held to the joined source's gate and to the query boundary

A caller's ad-hoc query could join a source it was not allowed to query, and read it.
`#(authorize)`, `#(access_filter)` and the `queryableSources` boundary ran on the run
target only, so `run: open_src extend { join_cross: g is locked } -> { group_by: g.secret }`
returned `locked`'s rows, a join into a hidden source returned its rows, and a join into a
row-filtered source returned every row.

A join the **caller** writes is now checked as if it were another run target:

| The caller joins                                  | Before         | Now                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| an `#(authorize)` source they are not admitted to | 200            | 403 naming the join alias                               |
| an `#(access_filter)` source                      | 200, every row | 200, their rows (the filter applies in the join's `ON`) |
| a source off the discovery surface                | 200            | 404 `Query target is not queryable.`                    |
| anything else, including an admitted lock         | 200            | 200                                                     |

Joins the **author** declares in the model are unchanged: joining sensitive data into an
ungated source still publishes it, as documented in `docs/authorize.md`. Named queries and
notebook cells are author text and are unaffected.

Also fixed here: Malloy keywords are case-insensitive, and `RUN:` / `SOURCE: x IS y` skipped
the pre-compile checks, including a `required` `#(filter)`. Every caller-text reader now
matches keywords in any case.

Also fixed here: a row filter now stays bound to the field it was written against. An inherited
filter (`where:`, a grafted `#(access_filter)`, or an injected `#(filter)`) that would evaluate
against a different field of the same name in the executed query, including inside a caller's join,
is refused with 403 instead of served. Renaming or excepting a field that no filter reads still works.

Every locked name in the request is now decided before compile, not only the run target and
its joins: a lock (`#(authorize)`) applies wherever its source's name appears, in any case,
inside backticks (decoded as Malloy decodes them), parentheses, `compose`, or a derivation
chain. The read over-collects on purpose -- it takes any identifier-shaped token, including
one in a comment or a string literal -- so a caller the lock refuses also gets 403 when some
other name merely matches it. The run target read before compile is the last `run:` in the
text, the one Malloy executes, and `/compile` at file or package scope walks, without a depth
cap, every derivation reachable from that final `run:` target -- or from every declared name,
when the text has no `run:` at all.

`#(filter)` is not a security boundary against caller-authored query text or
`bypassFilters`; use givens and `#(authorize)`.

**Who is affected:** callers who were reading through a join, or through a name the
pre-compile read missed, what they could not read with `run:`. If an app sends ad-hoc text
that reaches a gated or hidden source for users the gate does not admit, those requests now
get 403 or 404, and a refused caller also gets 403 for text that merely names a locked source.

## [0.8.0] — every document is framable only from its own origin, and the framing policy finally covers all of them (ACTION REQUIRED)

Two changes to `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors`, shipped together because
either one alone is misleading.

**The policy now covers every document.** It used to be set inside the route that
serves a package's `public/` files, so that was the only place it applied. The
Console catch-all sent no framing header at all, which meant notebooks, dashboards,
models and the Explorer stayed framable from anywhere — including on a deployment
that had set `PUBLISHER_FRAME_ANCESTORS` and reasonably believed it had configured
this. One middleware now sets the header ahead of every route.

**The default is now `'self'`, not `*`.** A page is framable only from its own
origin unless a deployment says otherwise.

**Migration.** If nothing embeds Publisher in an iframe from another origin, there
is nothing to do. If something does, set `PUBLISHER_FRAME_ANCESTORS` to the
embedding origins:

```
PUBLISHER_FRAME_ANCESTORS="https://app.example.com"
PUBLISHER_FRAME_ANCESTORS="https://app.example.com https://admin.example.com"
PUBLISHER_FRAME_ANCESTORS="*"          # the previous behaviour, chosen deliberately
```

The value is a CSP source list and is passed through as written. A deployment that
already set this variable keeps working and now gets the coverage it expected; the
break is for one that relied on the `*` default without setting anything.

The symptom if you miss it: the embedded page renders blank or is blocked, and the
browser console names `frame-ancestors`. Nothing fails server-side, so there is no
log line to watch for.

---

## [0.8.0] — compiling at the default scope no longer accepts text that declares its own data roots (ACTION REQUIRED)

`POST /…/compile` and the `compile_model` MCP tool default to `scope: "append"`,
where the submitted text is a fragment checked against a model that is already
published. Malloy resolves a source's schema at COMPILE time -- `duckdb.sql(…)`
sends a `DESCRIBE` before any query runs, and `connection.table(…)` fetches the
table's schema the same way -- so a compile-only endpoint still reached the
database, the filesystem and the network on the caller's behalf. Against DuckDB's
external access that made unrestricted compile an oracle rather than a check:
`read_csv('/etc/…')` distinguished an existing file from a missing one by its
error and named the columns of whatever it read, and `read_csv('https://…')`
issued the request. No rows were returned, so the exposure was disclosure and
SSRF rather than extraction.

Append text is now compiled under the same restricted mode `/…/query` already
applies. These are refused with a 400:

- `import`
- `connection.table(…)` and `connection.sql(…)`
- `given:` declarations
- `##!` compiler flags
- the raw-SQL function forms: `name!type(…)`, `sql_number`, `sql_string` and the
  rest of that family

**Migration.** Those constructs belong in a model file, so send text declaring
them at `scope: "file"` (validating an edit to one file) or `scope: "package"`
(checking every file as saved). Neither is restricted. Two workflows this
changes in practice: validating a not-yet-saved dashboard, which opens with an
`import`, and validating a new source rooted in a table -- including the
`source:` line `search_database_schema` hands back. Both want `"file"`.

Compiling at `append` also now requires the model named in the URL to load,
because the fragment is judged against that model's published surface and there
is nothing to judge it against otherwise. A model that **does not compile**
answers 400 carrying the model's own problems, which describe a file the caller
can already read. A model that **does not exist** answers 400 too, but
deliberately says only that it could not be loaded: naming what was wrong with a
path the caller supplied would answer "does this file exist" for any path.

Append text must also stand alone as top-level Malloy. A fragment that only
parses as a continuation of the model's last statement -- opening with
`extend {`, for instance -- is refused rather than compiled, because text that
does not parse on its own cannot be checked on its own.

`file` and `package` are unchanged and still unrestricted. `scope` is a
caller-chosen request field with no authorization difference between its values,
so this keeps fragment authoring on the model's published surface rather than
containing a caller who can simply ask for another scope.

## [0.8.0] — per-user visibility through a materialized grant table, and a public wrapper served from its fact

**A storage-materialized source may join a grant table that is itself scoped by givens.** The
visibility idiom — an org-scoped source joining an org-and-user-scoped grant table, with a dimension
that null-checks the join — was refused as `dynamic_joined_where`. It is now admitted when the joined
source is itself persisted with `storage=`, joined by name, and admissible on its own. Both artifacts
hold every caller's rows; the serve shape re-applies the grant table's terms per caller and re-emits
the join against that binding, so two users of one org get different answers from the same two
tables. If the grant table's binding is withheld (stale past its window, unbuilt, refused), the
sources joining it serve live and their siblings keep the tier. A revoked grant stays visible until
the grant table rebuilds: give the grant table a freshness window with `fallback="live"`, and do not
refresh it incrementally, since a deleted grant is never re-read by a delta — see
[materialization](docs/materialization.md#per-user-visibility-through-a-joined-grant-table).

The same rule lets a plain extension of a materialized source (`source: v is opps extend { join_one: …;
where: g.user_id = $USER_ID }`) be served from its parent's table, which previously required
`#@ -persist` and so served live.

**A public wrapper over a materialized private fact is served from the fact's table.** A source whose
query reads a persisted source (`orders is _orders_fact -> { select: * }`) has no binding of its own,
so on a storage destination it was an undefined name on the serve shape and every query naming it
served live. The wrapper is now carried onto the shape verbatim when everything it reads is on the
shape; one that reaches a warehouse table or an unmaterialized source still serves live.

**New plan field:** `PersistSourcePlan.joinedTerms` names each caller-scoped join, the joined source,
and the terms its binding re-applies. It is optional and additive: the key is absent unless a source
declares such a join, so no existing plan changes shape. A consumer generating a strict client from
`api-doc.yaml` rejects the field until it regenerates.


## [0.8.0] — a refused persist source is skipped, and no longer fails the whole run

**Before:** a materialization run stopped at the first persist source the eligibility gate refused. It built nothing, including every source the gate admitted, and ended `FAILED` with that one source's message. A single ineligible source therefore left the rest of its package unrefreshed on every run and every scheduled fire, until someone edited the model.

**Now:** a run skips a refused source and builds everything else. The run completes (`MANIFEST_FILE_READY`) and serves the refused source live, as before. Auto-run records each refused source in `metadata.refusedSources`, keyed by sourceID in the same shape as the build plan's `refusedSources`, and counts it in `metadata.sourcesRefused`. A build with caller-supplied `buildInstructions` reports an instructed source the gate refuses in the manifest's existing `failures`, under the instruction's `sourceEntityId`, with the gate's message as its `reason` and the new `SourceFailure.refused: true`, since that caller asked for the table; its siblings still build. `refused` tells a caller that retries failures this one will not clear until the model changes. It is the only schema addition, and it is optional.

A run still fails on a refusal when there is nothing else to build, because every source it targeted was refused, or when `sourceNames` names a refused source, because that caller asked for exactly the table that cannot be built. When several sources are refused, the error names all of them, not only the first in plan order. A refused `#@ preaggregate` rollup is recorded but never fails a run, as before.

**What to check.** Anything that read a `FAILED` run as the signal that a package holds an ineligible source should read `metadata.refusedSources` instead; the build plan's `refusedSources` reports the same refusals before any run. An auto-run whose only shortfall is refusals is metered `success`, since a refusal is a property of the model rather than of the run. An orchestrated run with an instructed refusal is metered `partial`, because that refusal is one of its `failures`: the caller asked for the table and did not get it. `publisher_materialization_sources_total` gains `outcome="refused"` and a `mode` label (`auto` | `orchestrated`) on every outcome. With `mode="orchestrated"` the refused count should stay at zero: a caller that builds from the build plan never instructs a source the plan refused, so a nonzero count means the plan and the build disagreed about a source.

## [0.7.0] — a package's `index.malloy` is its published surface

Put an `index.malloy` at a package root, `import` your models, and `export { … }` the sources you
publish. What it exports is what Publisher lists **and** what callers may query. `publisher.json`
needs no key at all.

```
sales/
  publisher.json     { "name": "sales" }
  index.malloy       import "orders.malloy"
                     export { orders }
  orders.malloy      declares `orders` and `orders_staging`
```

`orders_staging` still compiles, and other models can import, join and extend it, but it is not
listed and a direct query against it answers 404. `create-malloy-package` now scaffolds the file, so
a new package is curated from its first boot, and `examples/governed-analytics` has been converted:
it is the package that proved the convention can express a surface that used to need two manifest
keys.

**If you already have a package with a root `index.malloy` and no `explores`, this changes what it
serves.** That file becomes the surface, so your other models drop out of listings, `export { … }`
curation starts applying inside it, and **sources it does not export stop answering by name** — with
a 404 that is deliberately indistinguishable from "does not exist", because a 403 would confirm a
hidden name. Take an inventory before upgrading:

```bash
API=http://localhost:4000/api/v0
for env in $(curl -s $API/environments | jq -r '.[].name'); do
  for pkg in $(curl -s "$API/environments/$env/packages" | jq -r '.[].name'); do
    curl -s "$API/environments/$env/packages/$pkg/models" \
      | jq -e 'map(.path) | index("index.malloy")' >/dev/null \
      && echo "$env/$pkg has a root index.malloy"
  done
done
```

**To keep a package exactly as it was, add `"explores": []` to its own `publisher.json`.** An empty
array is read as a deliberate "do not curate" and suppresses the convention, so listings, `export {}`
filtering and query access are all unchanged. It has to go in the package source: setting it through
the API writes into the server's `publisher_data/` copy, which `--init`, a fresh server root, or a
replica that re-copies the package all revert, and a deployment with `"frozenConfig": true` refuses
the call outright.

Two shapes to watch for:

- **An aggregator index.** If your `index.malloy` is all `import`s and no `export { … }`, it exports
  nothing, so the package lists one model with no sources and looks empty. Add an `export { … }`
  naming what you publish, or take the `"explores": []` route.
- **A package with `dashboards/`.** A dashboard is served only when its file is a query entry point,
  and a dashboard file is not something an `index.malloy` can export — dashboards are files, not
  sources. So adding an `index.malloy` to a package that has dashboards **withholds every one of
  them**. The load warning now says so and names the fix, which is to declare an explicit `explores`
  listing both `index.malloy` and each dashboard file. None of the bundled examples is affected.

Do **not** rename the file to opt out. Renaming changes the model's identity, so
`…/models/index.malloy` starts returning 404, and if any sibling `import`s `"index.malloy"` the
dangling import fails the compile, which takes the **whole package** out of service rather than just
that file. Declaring `explores` with your old file list is not an opt-out either: it turns on
`export {}` filtering, which is a larger change than the one you are undoing.

### `explores` and `queryableSources` are deprecated, and still work

Nothing is removed. Both keys behave exactly as before and both are now marked `deprecated` in the
OpenAPI spec. A load-time warning naming the replacement goes only to the uses the convention
replaces: an `explores` naming one file, and `queryableSources: "declared"`.

Keep `explores` for the one thing the convention cannot express: a surface spanning **several**
files, which includes `index.malloy` plus the dashboard files it cannot export. That use gets no
deprecation warning. An explicit `explores` always wins, and a package with both an `index.malloy` and an
`explores` that omits it carries a warning rather than the server guessing.

**`index.malloy` does not replace `queryableSources: "all"`**, so `"all"` gets no deprecation
warning. `"all"` is the only way to curate listings *without* refusing queries, and a
surface derived from an `index.malloy` always enforces the boundary, because `queryableSources`
defaults to `"declared"`. If you want listings-only curation, keep both keys.

The `explores` field in a package response may now be a value the server derived rather than one the
author wrote, and the response does not distinguish the two — deliberately, because nothing
downstream treats them differently. **A derived surface is never written back to `publisher.json`.**
A client that GETs a whole package object, edits a field and PATCHes the object back re-sends the
derived list, and the server recognizes it and declines to persist it. Writing it would look inert —
an explicit `["index.malloy"]` and a derived one behave identically — right up until the file is
renamed: the convention follows the rename, a frozen key does not, and the package would then list
and serve nothing. A PATCH that names a genuinely different surface is persisted as before.

**A package curated by the convention alone says so at load.** When a root `index.malloy` becomes
the surface with no `explores` in `publisher.json`, the package carries a warning naming what that
withholds and how to opt out (`"explores": []`, which is the only opt-out: renaming or deleting the
file widens the surface silently and breaks every import naming it). It is the one path that curates
a package on the strength of a file rather than a manifest key, so it is the one an existing package
can meet by surprise; every other curation path already reported itself. A package whose
`index.malloy` is its only model withholds nothing and stays quiet, and notebooks do not count as
something withheld, because they are always listed and never subject to the boundary.

**A package says so when its published surface disappears.** Deleting or renaming a root
`index.malloy` resolves to no surface, which is an ordinary uncurated package, so the sources it was
withholding are listed and queryable by name again and nothing else reports it. Every other curation
change already left something to look at: a surface that appears warns at load, a malformed
`explores` refuses the load, a broken surface file fails the reload and is reported stale. The
reload that drops a surface now carries a warning naming what was published, what that means, and
how to restore it or keep the package open deliberately (`"explores": []`). Said once, on the reload
that caused it, because it reports a change rather than a state. That includes the reload a
materialization run or manifest rebind makes, not only `reload_package`, the watcher and
`?reload=true`. A server restart has no "before" to compare against, so a surface deleted while the
server was down widens without this warning. This is curation, not access
control: what widens is what is listed and what answers by name, and a source gated by
`#(authorize)` stays gated.

**A malformed `explores` fails the package load.** `"explores": "orders.malloy"` (the
missing-brackets typo) or an array with a non-string element is refused, with a message naming the
value and the fix, and the package is not served. It is not ignored: ignoring it resolves to no
surface at all, which publishes every source the key was written to withhold, and an absent package
is visible in `loadErrors` where a silently-uncurated one is not. This restores the behavior the key
had before the convention, when a non-string entry threw out of path normalization.

**A broken surface explains the 404s it causes.** A package whose surface files all fail to compile
exposes nothing, so *every* model in it, including the ones that compiled, is refused by name with a
404 that reads as "does not exist". It now carries a warning naming the broken files and how many
working models they took down. This is a narrow case by design: a compile error at first load fails
the package outright, and a failed reload from the watcher, `reload_package` or `?reload=true` keeps
the last good model serving and reports `stale: true` with the compile error, so neither empties the
surface. The gap is the materialization and manifest rebind paths, which replace a failed model with
a placeholder without going through the package loader. The refusal itself is unchanged and
deliberately fail-closed: falling back to uncurated on a typo would expose sources the author
curated away.

**A notebook path no longer skips the query boundary.** In a curated package, a query sent to a
`.malloynb` path used to bypass the surface entirely, so `run: hidden_source` addressed to a
notebook read any source that notebook imported, from any hidden file. That request now answers 404,
the same as it does addressed to any other file. Notebooks are still always listed, and their own
cells still run as written, including cells that read a hidden source the notebook imports. Only
query text a caller sends to the notebook's path is affected. This predates the `index.malloy`
convention and applied to any package with an `explores`.

**A missing model and a hidden one answer with the same 404.** A REST query to a model path that
does not exist now answers `No queryable model "<path>".`, the text a model that exists but is off
the surface already returned. It used to answer `<path> does not exist`, so the two messages told a
hidden file from a missing one. The status is unchanged, and MCP already answered both the same way.

**A dashboard tile the surface will refuse is reported at load.** A dashboard can be listed and
compile cleanly while a tile reads a source only an unlisted file declares. Compile is exempt from
the boundary, so the author sees nothing wrong until the tile answers 404 after publishing. The usual
cause is an import: listing a file publishes what it declares, not what it imports. Each such tile
now carries a package warning with severity `error`, on every load and reload, including the reload
`reload_package` runs and the one after a dashboard save. The warning names the tile and both fixes.
A tile whose source cannot be read from its text is not reported rather than guessed at.

## [0.6.0] (BREAKING) — `#(authorize)` is the lock and answers 403, `#(access_filter)` is the row filter, and `#(partition)` is gone


**Two annotations, one question each, and two different answers when they say no.**

| Annotation         | The question                              | A denial is              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `#(authorize)`     | may this caller reach this source at all? | **403**                  |
| `#(access_filter)` | which rows may they see, once they may?   | **200**, with their rows |

**This is a semantic flip, not a rename.** `#(authorize)` shipped as the row filter in every
release from 0.2.0 through 0.4.1. It now means the lock. There is no alias, no deprecation period
and no fallback: read this section before upgrading, because a model that keeps loading can still
change what it serves.

**Why the plain word moved.** A filter denies by matching no rows, which is honest — there really
are none for that caller. A gate that decides whether they may reach the source at all cannot deny
that way: `#(authorize) false` grafted as `where: false` makes `SELECT sum(salary) … WHERE FALSE`
one row of `NULL`, and `count()` zero. That is a fabricated answer about data the caller was
refused. The lock is decided instead, before their query is compiled, and returns a 403. The row
filter takes the name the surrounding world already uses — Looker and Omni both say
`access_filter`, and Spring Security splits `@PreAuthorize` from `@PreFilter`.

### What to do before upgrading

Both migrations are mechanical, and the second is the one that does not announce itself.

1. **A row-shaped gate must move to `#(access_filter)`.** `#(authorize) org_id in $GROUPS` is
   **refused at load** with a message naming the rewrite. Loud, and safe: the package does not
   serve until it is fixed.
2. **A caller-shaped gate keeps loading and starts answering 403.** `#(authorize) 'finance' in
$GROUPS` is already a lock by shape, so nothing refuses it — but a non-member who used to get
   200 with zero rows now gets a 403. **Anything keying on the status code — an alert, a retry
   rule, a client branch, a dashboard panel, a notebook cell — sees a different answer after
   upgrade.** This is the change to audit for, and there is no load error to find it for you:
   `grep` for `#(authorize)` bodies whose left side is a quoted literal.

Both names are snake_case, matching Malloy's own multi-word tags (`bar_chart`, `shape_map`). The
hyphenated spellings are refused at load naming the snake one, deliberately rather than aliased, so
exactly one spelling reaches a model and an audit that greps for gates cannot under-report.

**Rolling back is only safe if models roll back first.** No release before this one knows
`#(access_filter)`, and an unknown annotation route loads clean and serves every row. Downgrade
below this version with `#(access_filter)` in a published model and that gate silently stops
existing. Roll the models back first.

### The name declares the scope; nothing is inferred

The annotation you write says which question you are answering, and the body must conform or the
model does not load:

- `#(authorize)` takes `'<literal>' <op> $GIVEN`, plus the `true`/`false` sentinels. A field path on
  the left is refused (`row_level_term_in_authorize`).
- `#(access_filter)` takes `field_path <op> $GIVEN`. A literal on the left is refused
  (`source_level_term_in_access_filter`), and so is either sentinel (`sentinel_in_access_filter`).

**The mirror refusal is a security fix, not tidiness.** Until now the check ran one way only: a row
term on the caller route was refused, but a caller-shaped body on the ROW route was legal and
grafted as a constant predicate. So `#(authorize) 'finance' in $GROUPS` — the released spelling —
answered a non-member with 200 and zero rows. That is the fabricated answer this whole change
exists to remove, and it was reachable on the route nobody was looking at.

Both sentinels now live on the lock alone. `#(authorize) false` is how you lock a base;
`#(authorize) true` is how an extension re-opens one, since a source declaring no gate inherits its
ancestor's. `#(access_filter) false` is refused naming `#(authorize) false` — a total deny that
answers 200 with zero rows is exactly what the split removes. **The locked-base idiom is therefore
rewritten, not renamed:** every `false` base moves to the lock, and every re-opening extension to
`#(authorize) true`. See [docs/authorize.md](docs/authorize.md).

### The gate body parses a narrow grammar

The body was, until now, any Malloy boolean expression handed to the compiler unmodified —
including shapes that only failed at request time (a scalar/array mismatch against a warehouse
conversion error) or that loaded with a warning instead of a refusal (a negated membership test).
It now parses one or more terms joined only by `and`, with `<op>` fixed by the given's declared
arity (`in` for a list, `=` for a scalar). Anything else — `or`, `not`, `!=`, ordering comparisons,
a function call, a bare field reference, a literal on the right of a row-level term, an arity
mismatch — is refused at load with a named cause. Every ordinary term must reference a given, so
`#(access_filter) 1 = 1` is refused; combine what used to be one `or`-joined gate into two
extension sources, each with its own conjunctive gate — see
[docs/authorize.md § OR semantics](docs/authorize.md#or-semantics).

**A source may now declare more than one note on a route, and repeats AND together instead of
failing the load.** `assertAtMostOneAuthorizeGate` refused a second note outright in every released
version from 0.2.0 through 0.4.1, so no model that loads on a released version already has two of a
source's own notes to reinterpret; this is new capability, not a reinterpretation. Separately, and
more consequential: **a two-note declaring ancestor two or more `import` hops away now ANDs both
notes where it previously did not.** That case moves served rows silently, with no load error, so
it is worth auditing for rather than trusting to surface on its own.

### Three more behaviour changes the flip carries

**`/compile` evaluates the lock.** If reaching a source is what the word means, reading its SQL is
reaching it — so a caller the lock refuses cannot compile against that source, and `includeSql`
returns nothing. This closes a documented exposure (a gate referencing no given was admitted on
`/compile` whichever way it resolved, and returned the source's ungrafted SQL). The cost is real:
an author outside the group can no longer compile-check a locked source. `#(access_filter)` keeps
deciding on presence rather than value.

**The lock does not use the warehouse's collation.** It is decided in publisher, so `'Finance'` no
longer matches `['finance']`. On a MySQL tenant, whose default collation is case-insensitive, a
gate of this shape used to admit that caller. Fail-closed, but a real change — normalize case where
you resolve identity into givens.

**A denied caller's compile errors are no longer a schema oracle.** The lock is decided before the
caller's query compiles, so probing a locked source with a non-existent field returns the 403
rather than "field is not defined". That holds when the request declares its own alias for the
source (`source: s is locked extend {}`), through a chain of them, and on `/compile` as well as
`/query` — each reaches the compiler by a different route, and all of them decide the lock first.

The same rule cuts the other way for a caller the lock **admits**: an alias over a locked source is
served, exactly as the model-declared source would be. A source whose only gate is
`#(authorize) true` is therefore no more restrictive than an ungated one, which is what the
deliberately-open marker has to mean. An `#(access_filter)` still cannot be carried through a
request-declared alias — there is no graft target for it — so that refusal is unchanged.

### Metrics

`publisher_authorize_lock_total` is new, labelled `decision` (`admitted`, `denied_by_lock`,
`denied_unresolvable`). Only the last is a signal something is wrong; the middle one is the feature
working. It is a separate counter rather than a third value on
`publisher_authorize_row_level_total`, whose `denied_by_gate` is documented as the fail-closed
"could not apply the gate" case operators alert on — folding routine 403s in would fire that alert
on ordinary traffic.

**One dashboard-breaking change, and it is a change of MEANING rather than a disappearance.**
`publisher_authorize_admit_all_total`'s `route` label still reports `authorize`, but in 0.4.1 that
value meant the ROW route's admit-all and now means the LOCK's. A query matching
`route="authorize"` keeps returning data and is counting something different.

### `#(partition)` is removed

It predated `given:`/`#(access_filter)` as Publisher's own tenant-scoping annotation and has been
redundant with a row-level gate since that landed. A model still carrying it — on a `source:` line,
on a field inside one, reached through a join, on a top-level `query:`, or as a file-level
`##(partition)` — fails to load, naming it, with no fallback interpretation. Migrate it to an
equivalent `#(access_filter)` gate (or a scoping `where:`, if the intent was convenience rather
than a boundary — see [docs/row-level-access.md](docs/row-level-access.md)) before upgrading.

### For consumers generating clients from this spec

Five operations now declare `403` in `api-doc.yaml` — `post-querydata`,
`post-querydata-in-package`, `execute-query-model`, `execute-notebook-cell` and
`compile-model-source`. All five could already reach an `AccessDeniedError`; the spec did not say
so, so a generated client had no branch for it. Regenerate before upgrading.

### Also

`get_context` drops a source whose gate is an unconditional `false` from its listing entirely,
rather than reporting it as queryable and letting an agent learn only from the refusal. Every other
gate keeps being reported as before, because a caller's givens over that MCP path are untrusted and
evaluating a real rule there would be forgeable.

One risk worth flagging for anyone who kept a retired-form quoted-string gate declared outside a
package's own tree (see [docs/authorize.md § Declaring Gates](docs/authorize.md#declaring-gates)):
that gate was already denying every request with no compile-time hint, and nothing here changes it
— a leftover marker of that shape stays inert rather than becoming newly enforced, so it will not
surface as a load failure on upgrade. Search for it explicitly rather than relying on the release
to find it.

## [0.5.0] — an SSH tunnel with no pinned host key is now refused (ACTION REQUIRED)

`proxy.ssh.hostKey` pins the bastion's host key. When it was omitted the tunnel
connected to whatever key the far end presented, which means a
machine-in-the-middle on the publisher-to-bastion hop could not be detected. That
was the documented default, so a deployment relying on it is doing what the docs
told it to.

It now fails closed: a connection whose `ssh.hostKey` is unset is refused when a
query first uses it. **If you run an SSH-proxy connection without a pinned host
key, queries through it will start failing after this upgrade.**

Do one of the two below **before** the new image rolls, not after. The refusal
fires on the first query through an unpinned tunnel, so a deployment that waits
to react has already failed those queries.

Two ways forward, and the first is the one to prefer:

- Pin the key. Put the bastion's host key in `ssh.hostKey` -- an OpenSSH
  `known_hosts` line or a bare base64 blob, one per line. A load-balanced bastion
  presents a different key per backend, so list every backend's key; any listed
  key is accepted.
- Or opt out for the deployment. `PUBLISHER_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SSH_HOST_KEY=true`
  restores the old behaviour and logs a warning on every unpinned connect.
  `true`, `1`, `yes` and `on` all opt in, case-insensitive; an unrecognised value
  fails config load rather than leaving verification silently off.

To find the affected connections before upgrading, look for a connection with a
`proxy.ssh` block and no `ssh.hostKey`. After upgrading, you do not have to wait
for a failing query either: the tunnel is dialed lazily, and on config load this
release logs a warning naming each SSH connection that pins no host key while the
opt-in is off, so the list is in the startup log before anyone runs a query.

## [0.5.0] — compile and sqlSource now count against the concurrency cap

`PUBLISHER_MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES` bounds how much work a pod runs at once so a
flood cannot saturate it. It covered `query`, `sqlQuery` and `sqlTemporaryTable`,
but not `compile` or `sqlSource` -- and both of those reach the database too:
compile resolves a source's schema against the connection, and sqlSource runs a
live introspection. A burst of either bypassed the cap its sibling routes
enforce. The legacy `/projects/...` routes and the `compile_model` MCP tool had
the same gap, so all three surfaces are gated together; leaving one open would
just move the bypass.

What changes for an operator: the cap now has to be sized for authoring traffic
as well as query traffic. An agent loop or a notebook that compiles on every edit
draws on the same pool a query does, so a deployment that sits near its cap may
start seeing 503s on compile and sqlSource that it did not see before. The cap
defaults to 32 and `0` still disables it entirely. The dashboard save
(`PUT /environments/:env/packages/:pkg/models/*?`) admits here too: it compiles
the submitted text and rewrites the package under its lock.

A deployment that finds the cap too tight once authoring traffic counts against
it can raise `PUBLISHER_MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES` -- 64 or 128 -- rather than
leaving these routes ungated. Raise it knowing what it governs: one pool bounds
aggregate memory for concurrent warehouse work, so a cap sized to absorb
authoring pressure also raises the ceiling on concurrent query memory.

What this does not cover, so the entry is not read as a complete list:
`?reload=true` answers to the memory governor but not to this cap, and the REST
connection `schemas` and `tables` routes and the MCP `search_database_schema`
tool take no slot.

## [0.5.0] - two server defaults now close instead of open

Two settings that were open by default are closed. Both are silent until
something that relied on the old default stops working, so each needs a
deliberate step if you were depending on it.

**The authorize bypass now requires a secret.** `x-publisher-bypass-authorize`
disabled every `#(authorize)` gate on the presence of the header alone, with no
value to know. It now requires `PUBLISHER_BYPASS_AUTHORIZE_SECRET` to be set and
the header to carry that value; with the variable unset the bypass is refused
outright rather than allowed. If you relied on the bypass, set the variable and
send it as the header value, or stop relying on it.

**MCP binds loopback and no longer allows every origin.** The MCP server bound
`0.0.0.0` with a bare `cors()`, so it accepted connections from the network and
cross-origin requests from anywhere. It now binds `127.0.0.1` and reads allowed
origins from `MCP_CORS_ORIGINS`, defaulting to none. A remote MCP client that
could reach port 4040 can no longer do so: set `MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0` to restore the
old bind, and put a gateway in front of it (see `docs/security-posture.md`).

Know what widening it exposes before you do. MCP tools take `environmentName`
and `packageName` as ordinary arguments and the discovery tools treat them as
optional, so a caller who reaches the endpoint can enumerate every loaded
environment and the connections on each. Publisher has no tenant model to scope
that against, so a worker reachable by more than one tenant must not expose MCP.

MCP gets its own host knob rather than reusing `PUBLISHER_HOST`, because that
variable drove both the REST and MCP listeners -- defaulting it to loopback would
have moved the REST port to localhost too. Precedence is `MCP_HOST`, then an
explicit `PUBLISHER_HOST` so `--host` still moves both together, then
`127.0.0.1`. The REST default is unchanged.

## [0.5.0] — `configEtag`, so a writer can tell which Publishers still hold the config it sent

Credentials are never returned on a read, so a system distributing the same connection to several
Publishers could not confirm any of them was still holding the credential it last sent: a read tells
a Publisher holding _some_ password from one holding _none_, not one holding last month's from one
holding the current one.

`Connection.configEtag` is a new optional string the writer owns. Publisher stores it with the
connection, returns it on reads, and never derives, validates or interprets it — compute a tag over
the config you are about to send, send the two together, and compare what each Publisher reports
against what you would send now. A different tag, or none, means that Publisher was not given that
configuration. A write that does not carry a tag clears it, so a client that ignores the field is
unaffected and a config changed outside your writer stops hiding behind a tag it no longer matches.

It is deliberately not `fingerprint`, which identifies the _data_ a connection reaches and excludes
credentials so rotation does not re-address artifacts: two configs differing only by password share
a fingerprint, which is the case this exists to catch. [docs/connections.md](docs/connections.md)
has the comparison and the limits.

## [0.4.1] — the dashboard editor is not the only writer, and the browser is not the only store

`DocumentStorage` exists so the host decides where an authored document goes, but the
editor was written when the browser was the only implementation and the editor was the
only writer. Both assumptions were baked into its state machine, where they stayed
invisible while storage really was one person's browser and nothing else wrote the
package. Given a real backend, or a second writer, they became four ways to lose work.

**Two of them bite the Console today, on the package-write path shipped in 0.4.0.**
The hash a save hands back as `expectedHash` was taken from the latest fetch of the
file rather than from the file the builder opened against, so a save could present a
hash that matched a version the author had never seen, be accepted, and overwrite it.
And saving a resumed draft into the package remounted the builder onto the pre-save
package text, silently discarding the save that had just succeeded. Both are fixed.

**New in the interface.** A `Workspace` may now declare itself `authoritative`: its copy
IS the document, and the package file is a deploy of it. The editor then opens that copy,
writes back to it, and drops the "you have edits the package does not have" prompt, which
means nothing when the copy is the record. Omitting the flag leaves every existing host
exactly as it was. Absence now rejects with a `DocumentNotFoundError` rather than a bare
`Error`, so a read that failed is no longer indistinguishable from a document that is not
there; the editor refuses to arm Save on a read it could not complete, instead of
treating silence as permission to overwrite.

**Also.** A new version of the file arriving while there are unsaved edits is offered
rather than applied, so a background refetch no longer discards an author's work, and
saving through storage no longer throws away the undo history. `DashboardEditor` takes an
`onDirtyChange` callback for hosts that own the way out of the page. The toolbar caption
and the package page's draft list now say where a document is kept in the backend's own
words, taken from `Workspace.description`, instead of asserting "this browser".
`dashboard.saved` gains `where: "host"` and an optional `workspace`; `dashboard.opened`
gains `from: "record"`.

What this does not add is contention control on the record itself. `saveDocument` has
no expected-version slot, so two people editing one authoritative workspace are still
last writer wins, and the editor cannot detect it. Only the package path is
compare-and-swap protected.

## [0.5.0] — a colocated persist whose query is built with a given is refused

A given's value is substituted when the compiler compiles. Inside a persisted query the only value available is the declaration default, so it was baked into the relation — and persistence swaps only the source's `FROM`, leaving nothing to re-apply a filter that lives inside that relation. The table held one caller's slice and was served to everyone, whatever value they supplied. That shape is now refused.

**What is still admitted**, and is the documented form ([row-level-access.md](docs/row-level-access.md)): a given applied when the source is READ — a `where:` in the source's extend block, or a dimension, measure or join declared there. It never reaches the build, and binds per caller over the materialized rows. Only a given the persisted query is built with is refused.

```malloy
#@ persist name="refused"
source: refused is raw -> { where: org_id = $ORG_ID; select: * }

#@ persist name="admitted"
source: admitted is raw -> { select: * } extend { where: org_id = $ORG_ID }
```

**On upgrade**, such a package keeps loading and its source keeps serving — live, correctly, per caller. What changes is that its materialization run now 422s with the refusal, and an artifact built before the upgrade is unbound on the next reload rather than served. Moving the given out of the persisted query restores materialization; the refusal message names the placement.

The `storage=` tier applies the same rule, and only that rule — see the storage-tier note below, which ships in this release and replaces its blanket refusal of any given reference. `given_in_persisted_query` is therefore raised by both gates, for the one condition both share: the build would substitute a value.

**A new `reason` value.** Refusals are reported on the build plan, and this adds `given_in_persisted_query` to that enum. A consumer generating a strict client from an older copy of the spec can fail to parse a package whose plan carries it — which happens only for a package that actually has the refused shape. Regenerate against this release's `api-doc.yaml`, or expect the value.

## [0.5.1] — an incremental refresh can no longer write another caller's rows

**This fixes a bug that is reachable today**, on a colocated `#@ persist`. If a source is scoped by a given and also declares `merge_key=`, its incremental refresh could match rows belonging to other callers — and update them.

The key is the reason. `merge_key=` names what makes a row the same row, and an author chooses it against the source **as they wrote it**: filtered to one caller. `order_id` unique within an org is a reasonable identity for a per-tenant relation and reads that way in the model. The stored table is not that relation. A source's extend-block `where:` is not part of what the build persists, so the table holds every caller's rows and the term is re-applied per caller at read. That is the design, and for reads it is sound — but it leaves the author's key ambiguous over what was actually stored, where one `order_id` now occurs once per tenant. The refresh then issues `MERGE INTO <table> ON <the author's key>`, which matches across tenants. A cross-caller WRITE, not a read leak.

Nothing in the incremental path noticed. The existing guard forces a rebuild when a merge key is NARROWED, because rows the old key separated must not silently merge; here the key is unchanged and the POPULATION widened underneath it, which is not a case that check was built to see.

**What you would have seen.** On a colocated table in Postgres, a failed build: `MERGE command cannot affect row a second time`. The warehouse refused the ambiguous match, so the refresh was unavailable rather than wrong. That guard is the target warehouse's, not ours, and DuckDB has none — so the same shape on a `storage=` destination completed and left the rows wrong, with one caller's row destroyed and another's duplicated. No error, and the serve path reporting storage as usual. (A `storage=` destination could not hold a caller-scoped source before this release, so only the colocated case is reachable on 0.4.0.)

**The fix keeps your key.** The merge's match now also carries the columns the source's stripped terms constrain, so the effective identity is the key you declared plus the scope the artifact was widened past. `merge_key=` keeps meaning what you wrote it to mean, and nothing in the model changes.

Scoping is all-or-nothing. A term that names no column of the source — one reaching through a join — refuses the source at publish (`merge_key_scope_unresolved`) rather than scoping by the remaining terms, which would narrow the match without closing it. Scope such a source with a term over its own columns, or drop `merge_key=` to refresh by watermark range.

**A rollup over a caller-scoped source now refuses on its own grounds** (`preaggregate_over_dynamic_source`). Such a rollup already refused, but as a `given_in_persisted_query`, whose advice — move the given into the source's extend block — leads nowhere for a rollup, because that is where it already is: building the rollup reads the source, which applies that `where:` and substitutes the default. Unlike a persisted source, a rollup has no read-time re-application to put the term back, and no shape compile to fail closed if one were expected.

---

## [0.5.1] — a tenant-scoped source can be materialized into a storage destination

A source scoped to the caller — `where: org_id = $ORG_ID` — was refused for `storage=` outright, because any given reference was a refusal. That took the tier away from every multi-tenant model, which is most of the models worth materializing. Such a source now builds **once**, holding every tenant's rows, and is served per caller.

The refusal was aimed at the right danger and drawn in the wrong place. A persist source's build SQL is the persisted relation alone: an extend-block `where:` is not in it, so the given was never frozen into the artifact. What the build DOES substitute is a given the persisted query reads, and only the declaration's default is available then — so those rows are one caller's, and every later caller gets them. That shape is still refused, now as `given_in_persisted_query`, with a message naming the move that fixes it. It fires however the given reaches the query, including through the source the query reads.

**Three positions are refused although the build leaves them out too**: a declared `dimension:`/`measure:` (`dynamic_projection`), a join's `on:` (`dynamic_join`), and a given-scoped source reached through a join (`dynamic_joined_where`). None is in the artifact; each is refused because whether the serve shape reproduces it is a separate question, not yet answered.

**New: `#@ persist partition="org_id"`** lays the stored table out as one directory per value, so an equality term on that column reads only the files it names; `partition="org_id,day"` nests in the order given. It is a layout and carries no isolation — every stripped term is re-applied at read whether or not its column is partitioned, so a list that omits the scoping column costs a scan, never a leak. Each name must be a public column of the source, and `partition=` without `storage=` is refused rather than ignored.

**Serving change:** the transient serve-shape model now declares the author model's givens (defaults included), and a routed query no longer has its given values withheld. That withholding was correct only while the shape was built from given-free sources; a re-emitted `where:` that reads a given needs the value to reach it.

**One refusal narrowed.** The old gate walked the whole compiled source, so it refused a persist source that merely *reached* a given-filtered source through a join the persisted query never read. Malloy prunes such a join from the build SQL, so nothing given-derived was in the artifact; that shape is now admitted. A join the query **does** read still bakes the given's value into its `ON` condition and is still refused.

**A refused `#@ persist` now reaches its author.** A refusal was computed, recorded on the build plan and read by nobody: the package published, the source was served live, and whoever wrote the annotation was told nothing. Each one is now a package warning carrying the gate's own message — the same list the package page's notices surface. It is the one materialization finding the build plan cannot also be read for, since a refused `storage`/`colocated` source is absent from `sources` entirely, so nothing there records that the annotation was written at all.

Refusal reasons added to the eligibility enum: `given_in_persisted_query`, `dynamic_projection`, `dynamic_join`, `dynamic_joined_where`, `partition_without_storage`, `partition_column_unknown`, `partition_column_not_public`, `merge_key_scope_unresolved`, `preaggregate_over_dynamic_source`. A source previously refused as `given` now reports one of these.

## [0.4.0] (BREAKING) — materializations are package-scoped, and the environment-wide list is gone

A materialization is a run of one package's persist sources: `package_name` is NOT NULL on the row, every create takes a package, and the scheduler arms per package. The environment page nonetheless carried a second materializations surface on top of that — a cross-package list, plus a dialog that ticked packages and fired one ordinary per-package create for each — which read like a level of its own while offering strictly less than the package's own page. It is gone, and so is the one endpoint behind it, an aggregate that was the per-package query with the package predicate dropped.

**Removed:** `GET /api/v0/environments/{env}/packages/materializations`. Its per-package sibling, `GET /api/v0/environments/{env}/packages/{pkg}/materializations`, is unchanged, so a caller that wants the environment-wide view asks each package and concatenates. `malloy-pub list materialization` now requires `--package`; omitting it used to list the whole environment and now fails with `--environment and --package are required`. `EnvironmentMaterializations` is no longer exported from `@malloy-publisher/sdk`. All five package-scoped endpoints, the scheduler, and the table and its indexes are untouched.

**One thing comes back.** That aggregate had to be matched ahead of `…/packages/{packageName}`, which reserved `materializations` as a package name nobody could use. The reservation is lifted.

## [0.4.0] — the Console writes a dashboard into the package: a save endpoint, create, and drafts

The dashboard builder shipped in 0.3.1 with an Export button: it handed back a copy of the file for someone to put in the package by hand. The Console now closes the loop instead.

**New:** `PUT /api/v0/environments/{env}/packages/{pkg}/models/dashboards/<slug>.malloy`, for that one kind of file. In order: refused under `frozenConfig`; compiled _as the file_ and refused with its problems — line and column included — when it does not compile, writing nothing; then, under one hold of the package lock, the caller's precondition is checked and the file written atomically, the package reloaded in place, and, if the reloaded package does not compile the file, the previous text restored — or a new file removed — and the package reloaded again. A save never leaves a package serving less than it did.

The precondition is `expectedHash`, the SHA-256 of the text `GET …/models/{path}` returned. A file that changed since is refused with 409 and nothing merged. Omitting it means _create_, and a file that is already there is refused the same way — so an unconditional overwrite is not something a caller can ask for by leaving a field out. A create answers 201, a replacement 200, and the response carries the hash of what was written, which is the next save's `expectedHash`.

**Like every write on this server it is unauthenticated** and belongs behind the gateway; `frozenConfig` turns it off. It opens no door that was shut — a caller who can reach it can already register a package — and it is recorded in [docs/security-posture.md](docs/security-posture.md).

**In the Console:** Save writes into the package when the server takes writes, superseding a browser draft of the same file; a read-only server keeps the browser-draft flow. The package page gains an **Add dashboard** control (model, a source it declares, the first tile's view, a title) and a **Drafts** section listing this browser's saved dashboards, to open or delete. **Export is gone**, because Save is what it stood in for.

## [0.4.0] — the bundled examples no longer ship a notebook

`examples/storefront/storefront.malloynb` and `examples/governed-analytics/orders.malloynb` are removed. The `.malloynb` format is deprecated: read-only support stays, and a package that ships one still renders it, but a new narrative surface should be a dashboard until the authored notebook format lands. [docs/choosing-a-surface.md](docs/choosing-a-surface.md) says which surface to reach for.

## [0.4.0] — a failed connection test no longer returns the password

`POST /api/v0/connections/test` put the driver's error verbatim into `errorMessage`, and a DuckDB attach failure echoes the whole connection string — so testing a Postgres, DuckLake, or DuckDB-with-attachments connection that could not connect sent its cleartext password back to the caller, and wrote it to the server log. Both now go through the redaction the service already applied to its own copy, on the attach path as well as the controller's catch.

**If you were affected:** wherever a failed connection test's response or the server's log was captured — a browser network panel, a support bundle, a log shipper — that password is in the clear. Rotate it if any of those left the machine.

**Also fixed: duckdb and ducklake connection tests work again.** Since 0.0.193 the throwaway config behind a test was built with an empty environment path, so DuckDB rejected the empty working directory before any attach ran and every test of those two types failed with a validation error. The config is now rooted in a fresh temp directory, removed afterwards — which also means a connection test never reads, writes, or deletes an operator's own `<name>.duckdb`, and two tests of the same name cannot clobber each other.

**One new refusal.** A duckdb or ducklake connection name becomes a `<name>.duckdb` filename, so an unsafe one is now a 400 rather than a test that runs and fails. Names on every other connection type are unaffected.

## [0.4.0] — a materialized source's `where:` reaches the serve shape

A source's filter is part of what the source means, and the `storage=` tier was dropping it. The build SQL is the persisted relation alone, and the serve shape re-declared only dimensions, measures, joins and views — so the tier answered with **every row the source excludes**, silently, because a dropped filter still compiles. The colocated tier was never affected: substitution swaps only the `FROM` and leaves the reading query's own `WHERE` in place.

**Now:** the shape carries the source's `where:` clauses, one per `filterList` entry, and filters accumulate through `extend` the way they do in the model. They are kept at every tier of the shape ladder, so a source whose view cannot be reproduced loses the view and keeps the filter.

**A filter is the one exception to the per-query fallback rule**, deliberately. If a `where:` cannot be reproduced on the shape — one reaching through a join whose target is not materialized, or one over a column the source hides with `except:` — that source serves live rather than serving from storage without its filter. Its siblings keep the tier. Serving fewer queries from the tier is a cost; serving the wrong rows is not a trade worth making.

**If you were affected:** only a server running `PERSIST_STORAGE_MODE=on` served from the tier at all, and only a source carrying a `where:` answered wrongly — but every query against one of those, aggregates included, has been counting rows the filter excludes. The filter is applied when the artifact is read, not when it is built, so upgrading is enough: no rebuild, and nothing in the package changes. To confirm, compare a count against the same query served live.

## [0.4.0] — a storage build reaches a proxied Postgres source through its tunnel

A `storage=` build of a source on a Postgres connection that carries a `proxy` (an SSH tunnel to the tenant's bastion) failed on every attempt with `Unable to connect to Postgres at "host=<the database's own host> …": Connection timed out`, after a full TCP timeout per source. The query path opens the tunnel and connects through it; the build path handed DuckDB's `postgres` extension the connection's own host and port, which the bastion exists to keep unreachable. A proxied connection had never been built into a storage destination before — the passthrough was proven on BigQuery and Snowflake, whose federation has no network hop.

**Now:** the build federates a proxied Postgres source the way the query path connects to it. It opens the connection's SSH tunnel for the duration of the build, attaches DuckDB at the tunnel's local endpoint, and closes the tunnel when the build session is disposed — a failed attach closes it too. TLS is mapped from the connection's `sslmode` in libpq's vocabulary: unset or `no-verify` encrypt without verifying (`require`), `verify-ca` verifies the chain against `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` (passed as `sslrootcert`), and `verify-full` verifies the chain against the runtime's bundled roots plus `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` — the trust set the query path uses, so no bundle is required — and the hostname against the database's own name, because libpq dials the tunnel as `hostaddr` while `host` keeps the real name. Values are quoted for libpq, so a password carrying a space or a quote connects as it does on the query path. Unproxied Postgres, BigQuery and Snowflake sources are unchanged.

**If you were affected:** rebuild. The refusal never reached the source's definition, so nothing in the package changes.

## [0.3.1] — a dashboard builder, and the storage seam a host has to supply

Publisher now ships a WYSIWYG editor for a package dashboard: tiles arranged by drag, a filter strip
whose controls are written into the file as `given:` declarations, per-tile drill targets, and a
splice-writer that rewrites only the bytes it owns so comments, ordering and everything it does not
manage survive the round trip. `/<environment>/<package>/dashboards/<slug>/edit` opens it in the
bundled app.

**It is a separate entry point, and that is deliberate.** Import it from
`@malloy-publisher/sdk/builder`, not from the package root, and load it lazily —
`React.lazy(() => import("@malloy-publisher/sdk/builder"))` is what the bundled app does. The builder
reads Malloy with the Malloy parser, which is 440 KB gzipped, and nothing reachable from the main
entry imports it. A single static import anywhere on your main path hoists all of it into every page
load. That entry also installs a `globalThis.process.env` shim the parser's dependencies need in a
browser, and it has to evaluate before the parser's chunk does, which is the other reason not to
reach past it into the component file.

**Saving is yours, not ours.** The editor writes through a `DocumentStorage` the host supplies
through `DocumentStorageProvider` — `listWorkspaces`, `getDocument`, `saveDocument`,
`deleteDocument`, `moveDocument`, over a `{workspace, type, path}` locator. `BrowserDocumentStorage`
is exported and keeps documents in `localStorage`, which is what the bundled app uses and is enough
to try the builder, not enough to share one. A host with no provider still gets the editor, without
Save. Two things to know before writing an implementation: `saveDocument` carries no version or etag,
so a backend that needs a precondition has to hold one itself and reject a stale write, and the
editor opens on the first workspace `listWorkspaces(true)` returns, so return the one you mean to
save into.

**The package dashboard is a read-only origin.** Editing works on a copy, the copy goes wherever the
host keeps documents, and "Export" hands the file back so it can be put in the package. There is no
server write path and this release does not add one. The cost is stated in the toolbar rather than
hidden: a control added in the builder is live in the editor, because its value is written into each
tile's query, but it reaches the package only when the exported file does.

**One thing a dashboard author should know.** The file the builder writes is package text, and
Publisher reads an `#(authorize)` gate from a declaration in the package. A `given:` the builder
writes is presentation — it does not bound what a viewer can reach, and it is not a tenant boundary.
Treat a dashboard as model text for review purposes, because that is what it is.

## [0.3.0] — a dashboard's description is its narrative header, and it renders as markdown

A dashboard could already carry a block of prose and was throwing it away at the last step. Malloy
delivers a doc comment with its newlines and blank lines intact — measured, `'## Why this page
exists\nRevenue is up but margin is flat.\n\nThe tile below says where it went.'` reaches the manifest
exactly like that — and Publisher rendered it as a plain `Typography`, which collapsed the lot onto
one unstyled line with the asterisks showing.

It renders as markdown now: paragraphs, emphasis, lists, links and inline code. Headings stay at body
weight, because a heading in a description is a section label inside the page rather than a
competitor to the page's own title. The bundled `storefront` overview has a real one to copy from.

Two things worth knowing when writing one. On a composite the lines are model-level (`##"`), because
a doc comment attaches to an object and at model level there is none — a `#"` there fails the package
load with "Object annotation not connected to any object"; the single-query form is the other way
round, with `#"` attached to its `query:`. And this is the whole prose surface a dashboard has: per
page, plus a one-line `# subtitle` per tile. Prose BETWEEN tiles needs a tile kind the format cannot
express yet.

## [0.3.0] — a property on a tile entry is reported instead of dropped

`tiles=[intro { kind=text }]` compiled, loaded clean, and silently became the tile `intro` — a run
expression that does not resolve, reported as a query error with no hint that the tag was the
problem. The shape parses today, so an author who has read about tile kinds anywhere can write one
and be told nothing about why it did not work. The package lint now names the property and says where
per-tile presentation actually goes.

## [0.3.0] — a composite dashboard's tiles are cards again

A tile on a `## artifact { tiles=[…] }` dashboard painted MUI's white instead of the instance theme's
`tile` colour, which the theme itself describes as "a faint tint so tiles read as recessed cards on
the page". The single-query `# dashboard` form has always painted it. On a theme whose page is also
white, that was the difference between tiles that read as cards and tiles that read as nothing, and
it is the visible half of #1069's "they render differently".

Measured on the `grid`/`tiled` fixture pair, which is the same layout authored both ways: radius
(4px), padding (20px), border, shadow and grid gap already agreed, and the background was the last
piece that did not. Both forms are now pinned against one sentinel colour in the browser suite, so
neither can drift from the other unnoticed.

Height stays deliberately different: a composite tile is capped so a grid of independent queries
keeps even rows, where the single-query form sizes to its content.

## [0.3.0] — a result panel is sized by what the renderer says it is, not by its DOM

A panel decided its height by walking three levels into `@malloydata/render`'s output and reading
whichever node it landed on, plus a class-name check on `.malloy-dashboard` for the one shape that
needed a fourth. The renderer publishes no size API, so something has to be measured — but WHICH
rule applies is now read from the renderer's own metadata rather than from its markup, and every
height decision lives in one module with tests instead of four unreconciled constants across as
many files.

Two visible fixes come out of it:

- **A KPI row no longer sits in a band of empty space.** A `# big_value` tile measured once, lost
  the race with the renderer's layout, and recorded the box it had been handed. Measured: a tile
  whose content is 136px tall kept the full 400px cap. Roots that have a height of their own —
  tables, `# dashboard` grids, big values, lists, maps — are now re-measured until they settle.
- **A chart is no longer measured at all.** A chart fills the box it is given and reports back an
  inset of it (measured: 392 in a 400px tile, 692 in a 700px cell), so measuring one only ever fed
  its own height back to it. The single-query dashboard form used to ask for a 20000px "no cap"
  height, which a bare `# bar_chart` painted at and then kept — 1992px for a two-row chart. "No
  cap" is now the absence of a cap rather than a number standing in for one, and a chart takes the
  caller's height.

Which rule a result follows comes from the root's render plugin where there is one:
`sizingStrategy: "fill" | "fixed"` is the renderer answering this exact question, and a host's own
plugin is placed by its own declaration rather than by a name this SDK has to recognise. A table and
a `# dashboard` grid have no plugin, so `renderAs()` still carries those.

The bundled `storefront` dashboard also gives its map row six and six columns instead of eight and
four. A root `# shape_map` is drawn at a fixed 588px wide — the renderer builds its spec from a
hardcoded 500x350 and no tag reads those numbers — so a narrower tile clips it rather than shrinking
it, and at four of twelve the east coast and the whole legend were cut off. This is the example
fitting the renderer's constant, not a fix for it: below a grid of about 1220px it clips again.

For SDK consumers: `ResultContainer`'s `maxHeight` is optional now, and leaving it out means no cap.
`RenderedResult` gains an `onSizing` callback reporting which rule a result follows, and its
`onSizeChange` fires only for results that have a height of their own. Each rendered result also
carries `data-malloy-render-as` and `data-malloy-sizing` on its stage, so a panel at an unexpected
height says which rule it took.

## [0.3.0] — a dashboard imports its givens file whole

The bundled examples, the dashboards doc and the `malloy-dashboards` skill all named the givens a
dashboard uses (`import { CATEGORY, BRAND, … } from '../givens.malloy'`). They import the file whole
now. A control renders for a given the tiles actually _reference_, not for every one in scope, so
the whole-file form brings no controls you did not ask for, and a named list only gives an author
something to forget — with a missing control, not an error, as the result. It is also what Malloyyo
documents for the same format, so a repo written for either side reads the same. Sources are
unchanged and still named individually, which is the right form where a file wants a few specific
things.

Nothing about where a given is _declared_ changes: that is the model, and `givens.malloy` is where a
package keeps it, because the MCP surface, row-level access and `#(authorize)` all read it. The doc
now also records that declaring one in a dashboard file works — the control renders and the tile
filters — for a page that owns its own knob. That is the exception, not the convention.

## [0.3.0] — dropdowns over a gated source load their options

A `control=select` whose `suggest` read a source gated by `#(authorize)` (or scoped by a
source-level `where:` on a given) resolved to "Options unavailable": the option query carried no
givens, so the gate denied it. The server now names, per suggest, the givens its source is gated or
scoped by (`GivenSuggest.givenNames`, also on a named `suggest { query=… }`'s own references), and
the SDK sends the current values of exactly those with the option query and keys its cache on them.
No other applied filter is sent, so the option list still does not depend on the rest of the page.
`useSuggestOptions` takes the applied values as a new trailing optional argument; a caller that
omits it, or a server too old to name the givens, behaves as before.

## [0.3.0] — a control with a starting value can be cleared

A given seeded by `# artifact { givens { … } }` (or a notebook's `## givens { … }`) could not be
cleared: the × dropped it from the URL, the host fed that URL back in, and the control snapped
back to the starting value. The hook now recognises its own report arriving back through the host
and keeps the reader's edits across it, while a URL it did not write (a drill landing, the Back
button, a pasted link) still resets the controls as before. The limitation was documented as
unreachable when no server populated starting values; both dashboards and notebooks have since.

## [0.3.0] — `ApiErrorDisplay` is exported; two internal names are not

`@malloy-publisher/sdk` now exports `ApiErrorDisplay` and its props type. `Dashboard`,
`DashboardTile` and `Notebook` all present request failures through it, and the SDK README has
shown it in examples for some time, but a host could not import it to match. Two names that leaked
through the barrels without being documented are no longer exported: `SourceExplorerComponent`
(the inner half of `SourcesExplorer`, which is the component to use) and `makeDimensionKey` (an
internal of `useDimensionalFilterRangeData`; `getDimensionKey` stays).

## [0.3.0] — the `pages/` URL alias is gone

Data apps were renamed from `pages/<file>` to `data-apps/<file>` in 0.0.242, and that release
promised the old spelling would stop redirecting one release later. It kept redirecting for
twenty-five. It stops now: the Console no longer rewrites `/<env>/<pkg>/pages/<file>` to the new URL,
and the server no longer treats `pages` as an app route. A bookmark on the old spelling 404s, and
a package that ships its own `public/pages/` directory has those files back at
`/<env>/<pkg>/pages/<file>`, which the alias had been shadowing.

## [0.3.0] — the Workbook editor is gone; storage is now `DocumentStorage`

**Removed: the Workbook editor.** `Workbook`, `WorkbookList`, `WorkbookManager`, and
`AnalyzePackageButton` are no longer exported from `@malloy-publisher/sdk`, and the Console's
`/<env>/<pkg>/workbook/<workspace>/<path>` route is gone. The editor saved its own JSON to browser
storage, could not write a `.malloynb`, and had no link to it anywhere in the Console since August
2025: a notebook click has opened the read-only `Notebook` view all along. Authoring returns with
the dashboard builder, which will cover the notebook case with text tiles in a one-column layout.
The `@uiw/react-md-editor` dependency and the `@malloy-publisher/sdk/markdown-editor.css` export
went with it; `styles.css` no longer imports that stylesheet.

**Renamed: `WorkbookStorage` is `DocumentStorage`.** The storage seam the editor used stays, as the
interface a host hands the SDK for whatever it authors: `DocumentStorage`, `DocumentStorageProvider`,
`useDocumentStorage`, `BrowserDocumentStorage`, `DocumentLocator`, and `Workspace`, with methods
named `listDocuments`, `getDocument`, `saveDocument`, `deleteDocument`, `moveDocument`. A locator now
carries a `type` (`"dashboard"` or `"notebook"`), and `listDocuments` can filter on it. The browser
implementation namespaces its keys under `publisher:document:`, so it lists only its own documents
rather than everything the page keeps in localStorage.

**Breaking for hosts of `@malloy-publisher/app`:** `createMalloyRouter`'s second argument and
`MalloyPublisherApp`'s `workbookStorage` prop are now `documentStorage`, and both are optional,
defaulting to `BrowserDocumentStorage`. A host that passed a `WorkbookStorage` implementation renames
its methods and adds `type` to its locators. No known host did.

## [0.3.0] — dashboards written for Malloyyo look the same here

Three behaviors that differed on identical Malloy between Publisher and
[Malloyyo](https://github.com/malloydata/malloyyo), found by checking Publisher's port against
Malloyyo 0.2.44:

- **A composite tile that is one row of measures renders as KPI cards**, the way Malloyyo splices the
  same tile into its grid, rather than as a one-row table. `# big_value` on the view still says so
  explicitly; any render tag on the view, `# table` included, is respected as written.
- **A `filter<date>` or `filter<timestamp>` given gets a time-range control**: Today, the last 7, 30
  or 90 days, the last 12 months, or a custom range of days. The presets are spelled in Malloy's
  filter grammar (`7 days`, `12 months`), the same values Malloyyo writes, so a URL from either host
  reads on the other. A custom range is inclusive on both ends as picked; a single day keeps the date
  picker, and any other filter keeps the text box, as written.
- **The `range_min`/`range_max` slider has two handles** and writes an inclusive range, `[10 to 20]`.
  With the upper handle at the ceiling it writes the lower bound alone, `>= 10`, which is what the
  one-handled slider wrote, so existing links and starting values still place the handles.

And one thing that was silent now speaks: an `# artifact` tag on a source **view**, which Malloyyo
serves and Publisher never read, made the file a shared include with nothing reported. It is now a
package warning that names the two forms Publisher does read. The dated comparison lives in
[docs/malloyyo-dashboards-design.md](docs/malloyyo-dashboards-design.md#where-publisher-diverges).

## [0.2.7] — bound how far the Snowflake driver reads ahead of a slow consumer

The Docker image now installs a small shim in front of the ADBC Snowflake driver
that can set `adbc.rpc.result_queue_size` on every Snowflake statement. It is
**opt-in**: with `ADBC_RESULT_QUEUE_SIZE` unset — the default — the shim is a
pass-through and the driver behaves exactly as upstream ships it. The image itself
is different (the extension now loads the shim, which loads the upstream driver
beside it), but with the variable unset the shim sets nothing and forwards every
call. Set `ADBC_RESULT_QUEUE_SIZE=1` on the deployment to turn the bound on. Non-Docker installs are unaffected either way, because the
`snowflake` extension has no way to set this option and the server process does
not touch it.

Why: the driver prefetches result chunks ahead of the consumer with no bound tied
to consumption — a chunk's goroutine releases its concurrency slot as soon as its
download finishes, while the decoded records stay queued. Whenever a
`snowflake_query()` stream is consumed more slowly than the network delivers it,
which is what a `CREATE TABLE AS` into DuckLake on object storage does, the
_remaining result set_ accumulates in memory outside DuckDB's buffer manager,
where `PUBLISHER_DUCKDB_MEMORY_LIMIT` neither sees nor bounds it. On a ~140M-row
materialization that was an 8 GiB worker OOM-killed on every attempt; the two
DuckLake write bounds shipped in 0.2.3 and 0.2.4 raise the consumer's throughput
and are still load-bearing, but could never close a gap whose other side is
unbounded.

Measured on `TPCH_SF100.ORDERS LIMIT 20M` with a deliberately slow writer, peak
cgroup `anon`: 3325 MiB at the driver default — the whole result resident with
1% consumed — against 286 MiB flat at `1`, byte-identical output. On a fast
100M-row aggregate the bound cost nothing measurable and removed the 400–1000 MiB
the default buffered there too. `adbc.snowflake.rpc.prefetch_concurrency`
(`ADBC_PREFETCH_CONCURRENCY`) is exposed alongside but left at its default, since
it is the throughput knob rather than the memory one.

This is an interim, and `packages/server/adbc-shim/README.md` says exactly when
it comes out: when the extension exposes the options
([iqea-ai/duckdb-snowflake#66](https://github.com/iqea-ai/duckdb-snowflake/issues/66))
or the driver bounds its read-ahead by consumption as its documentation already
implies ([adbc-drivers/snowflake#197](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/snowflake/issues/197)).

## [0.5.0] — the dashboard editor can now filter a tile whose view is written inline

A dashboard tile's filter control used to refuse to bind on an `inline` tile — `view: x
is { aggregate: … }` — because the only write path was a `+ { where: … }` refinement
after the view reference, which does not exist to append to when there is no reference.
That excluded the majority of real dashboards: writing a view's body inline, rather than
as a named reference, is the common way people write one, and the bundled
`tiled.malloy` fixture is entirely inline tiles.

The fix is a second write path, not a workaround: a binding on an inline tile is now a
depth-1 `where:` statement inside the body's own first stage, which is valid Malloy and
reads back exactly like a reference tile's refinement does. Only that shape is
recognized — a nested `where:` inside a `nest:`, a compound predicate such as `where: a
~ $A and c = 1`, and a source-level `where:` outside any view are all left exactly as
written, never touched and never reported as a binding. Where a body has more than one
stage, only the first is the tile's own: `{ … } -> { … }` takes its binding in stage one
and nothing is ever written into a later stage, while a body with no single first stage
-- a `{ … } + { … }` compound refinement, or a pipeline starting from a named view --
refuses a filter change with a reason naming the shape.

Recognizing that shape is a question about statements, and every scan here reads a line
at a time, so the two can disagree: a clause list or a predicate carried onto a second
line (`where: a ~ $A,` then `b ~ $B`) is only half-visible to a line-oriented reader.
Such a `where:` is now unmodeled Malloy on both write paths -- read past, written around,
never rewritten -- because rewriting the half that was read would strand the half that
was not. The same isolation rule now governs a `+ { where: … }` refinement, which
previously matched binding clauses anywhere in the refinement with no such check.

Two guards back that up. A given already filtered on by a `where:` the builder does not
manage cannot also be bound as a managed clause, because the two would filter on the same
control while only one could ever be unbound again; that is refused with a reason naming
the given. And every rewrite is now parsed by Malloy before it is written: a file that
parsed before the edit must still parse after it, or nothing is written. That check sees
the whole file, which the existing read-back gate cannot -- the gate compares tiles, tags
and filters, so text stranded beside a clause it rewrote is invisible to it.

**What the live editor shows while you work:** adding a filter to an inline tile previews
correctly. Removing or changing one does not take effect in the preview until the file is
saved, because the tile's preview runs the saved view, whose body already holds the saved
`where:`, and the builder has no way to name that view unbound. A reference tile is exact
either way, because it refines its base view. The saved result is correct in every case;
this is the preview only.

**Consequence for an existing file:** an author's own `where: x = $Y` written at depth 1
of an inline view's first stage is now builder-managed the same way a reference tile's
refinement already was. Once that filter's control is touched through the builder and
the file is saved, that `where:` is regenerated from the control's bindings rather than
preserved verbatim — the same contract a reference tile's refinement already had, now
extended to the more common inline shape.

**Comments, in all three spellings Malloy accepts.** `//`, `--` and `/* … */` are all comments
to Malloy's lexer, and the builder knew only about `//`. Two consequences are fixed. A
`/* … */` was absent from the comment index, so it was invisible to every guard that asks
whether a range about to be deleted holds one: removing a filter across a block comment deleted
it and reported success. And a `--` or `/* … */` line written between a `#` tag and the
declaration it annotates stopped the walk that finds a tile's tags, while the parser read
straight past it — so a retag wrote a **second** `# colspan` below the comment, the reader read
the lower one back, and the read-back gate was satisfied by a file now carrying two. That
hand-written walk is gone; where a tag block begins now comes from the lexer, which also
means a line inside a `/* … */` that happens to begin `#` is read as the prose it is rather
than as a tag to report or rewrite.

**A tile the builder cannot bind is no longer described as somebody else's.** A `->` pipeline
from a named view, or a chained `vx + { … } + { … }` where no one block is where a binding
belongs, is declared right there in the dashboard file — but the tile menu said it was declared
on its source, which is untrue and hid the fact that its tags are the builder's to write. Such a
tile now reads as declared here, with the shape named; its label, subtitle, colspan and position
stay editable like any other tile's, only the filter control is off, and the reason a filter
change gives points at the body rather than sending you to the model file.

**One rule for the three removal paths.** Removing every clause of a `where:` used to delete a
comment written inside it, or leave one trailing it stranded above the closing brace, while
collapsing a refinement over a comment refused. All three now answer the same question the same
way: a comment goes only with a declaration you asked to delete outright — removing a **tile**
still takes its own comments with it, and the builder shows that diff before a structural save
— while a filter edit, which rewrites a declaration that stays, refuses rather than destroying
or stranding a comment it was not asked about, and names the comment in the reason.

---

## [0.5.0] — `DashboardEditor` takes a `resourceUri`, and can now open a pinned version

`DashboardEditor` was the only resource-addressed component in the SDK still taking loose
`environmentName` / `packageName` props, under a `dashboardName` that disagreed with
`Dashboard`'s own `dashboard` for the same slug, and with no way to pin a `versionId` the
way every other resource-addressed component can. It now takes `resourceUri` + `dashboard`,
matching `Dashboard` exactly; the old `environmentName` / `packageName` / `dashboardName`
form still works, deprecated rather than removed, so an existing integration is unaffected.

A `versionId` on the URI pins every read the editor makes — the file, the manifest, the
dashboard list, the catalog behind the filter window's field search, and, through the live
surface it renders, each tile's query and each control's suggest query — the same as it
already does for `Dashboard`. It never reaches the write: Publisher answers `501 Not
Implemented` to a `versionId` on `updateModelSource`, and a version is a fixed point in
history regardless, so a pin against a package that would otherwise take the editor's
writes now turns Save off instead, with the toolbar caption saying why. A save into a
host's own document store or a browser draft is unaffected, since neither goes through
that endpoint.

---

## [0.2.7] — 500 and 502 responses no longer echo the internal error

A 500 or a 502 returned `error.message` verbatim. That message is not always
something a caller should see: an unrecognised internal failure carries a stack
fragment or a filesystem path, and a connection failure wraps the driver's own
text, which can name an internal host and port, echo the SQL the caller sent, or
distinguish "refused" from "timed out" from "auth failed" -- a reachability
oracle for anything the server can reach.

Both now answer with a fixed message (`Internal server error.`,
`Upstream connection error.`) and the real error is logged server-side instead.
The status codes are unchanged.

The MCP endpoint gets the same treatment for the same reason. An unclassified
tool error is answered by `getInternalError`, and a connection failure matches
none of the classifier's branches, so the driver text withheld over HTTP would
otherwise have stayed readable over `/mcp`. It is now withheld there too. Only
that class is withheld: an operational failure keeps its message, because a tool
error that says nothing is what the classifier exists to avoid.

Two things are deliberately _not_ generalised, because the point is to drop what
a caller cannot use rather than everything:

- Every 4xx keeps its message. A 400 compile error, a 404 naming the package it
  could not find, and the 424 that quotes an offending annotation are all
  actionable, and a caller needs them to fix the request.
- A 502 the server wrote itself keeps its message too. A message the server
  composed names nothing internal, so it is marked caller-safe at the point it is
  raised; only the driver passthrough is generalised. A new throw site that does
  not mark itself is generalised by default. (The table-not-found case that used
  to rely on this is a 404 in 0.2.6, so it no longer reaches the 502 branch at
  all.)

If you parse the body of a 5xx rather than reading its status, that text is now
fixed. The detail moved to the logs, which is where it was always meant to be:
before this change it reached them only incidentally, via response-body logging.

---

## [0.2.6] — a bad table reference answers 404 or 400, not 502

A table path that names nothing, or that the dialect cannot parse at all, is the
caller's mistake. Both used to be reported as `502`, so browsing for a table that
turned out not to exist read as a server fault: it counted against a downstream
server-error budget and, on one deployment, paged on-call twice in an afternoon for
what was a modeler mistyping a table name.

`404` was already the declared contract for these routes and `502` appears in no spec
for them, so this is conformance rather than a break. `400` is newly declared
alongside it.

**A 404 now carries `reason: "TABLE_NOT_FOUND"`.** A caller that retries a 404 by
re-resolving which server hosts a resource has to tell that case apart from a table
that is simply absent, and the status alone cannot say which. `Error` also gained
`code`, the status repeated in the body. Both are optional, so an existing client is
unaffected — but a client built by a strict generator against the previous spec will
reject the new fields until it is regenerated.

`reason` is an open string rather than an enum on purpose. A generator renders an
enum closed, so adding a second value later would break every client generated
before it, on the one field whose whole purpose is to grow. Treat an unrecognized
value as absent.

**Only two dialects are classified, and the rest deliberately still answer 502.**

Guessing on either of the bottom two would be worse than a 502, and anything
unrecognized stays `ConnectionError`/502 so that a real outage stays loud. A
not-found is now logged at warn rather than error, so a path being typed cannot fill
the error log.

---

## [0.2.5] (BREAKING) — `#(partition)` is a column and given pair, grafted at read time

`#(partition)` used to name a given and leave the predicate to the author: a
`filter<T>` given plus a matching `where:` in the source body. It is now a single
annotation carrying both facts, in the shape `#(authorize)` already uses, and the
server builds the predicate itself.

```malloy
// before
given:
  TENANT :: filter<string>
#(partition) $TENANT
source: tenant_orders is duckdb.table('orders.csv') extend {
  where: tenant ~ $TENANT
}

// now
given:
  TENANT :: string
#(partition) tenant = $TENANT
source: tenant_orders is duckdb.table('orders.csv')
```

**What to do.** Rewrite the annotation as `<field path> = $GIVEN`, drop the
`where:` from the source body, and change the given's type from `filter<string>` to
`string`. The old form does not carry forward.

**The given is a plain scalar type now, not `filter<T>`.** The server builds the
predicate as an equality, so the given is compared with `=` and wants a plain
`string` (or another scalar). `filter<T>` was only ever needed by the old form's `~`
match against an author-written `where:`.

**Where the filter lands.** The pair is grafted onto the entry point's own
`filterList` through the same mechanism `#(authorize)` uses, so a plain source read,
a named query invoked by `queryName` alone, an ad-hoc caller-declared derivation, and
a notebook cell are all filtered. It composes conjunctively with an `#(authorize)`
gate. It is skipped under `bypassAuthorize`, the trusted server-side bypass, which
is how a trusted scan reads across every partition at once; `bypassFilters`, the
legacy `#(filter)` control, never skips it.

**Three fail-closed protections now check `#(partition)` explicitly.** Moving the
predicate out of the source body removes the given reference those checks keyed on,
so each gained its own check rather than inheriting one: storage-destination
materialization eligibility, colocated persist, and the storage and pre-aggregation
routing veto.

**Refused at publish, each with its own cause.** A composite source that declares
`#(partition)` itself or whose member declares it; a marker the entry-point resolver
cannot reach, meaning one line too low — on a dimension, a view, or inside an inline
`compose(...)`; and a malformed annotation body or a duplicate given. An unreadable
ancestry chain is treated as a marker being present and denies, rather than reading
as unpartitioned.

The composite case was measured, not theorized: wrapping a partitioned source in
`compose(...)` read **every** partition. Grafting resolves to the composite's own
contents entry, while a composite run target compiles against a distinct resolved
member branch, so the filter never landed. A marker on the composite itself denied
loudly; a marker on one of its members was silent, which is why both are now refused.

`BuildPlan.refusedSources` gained `partition` to its reason enum alongside
`free_parameter`, `given` and `authorize`.

---

## [0.2.5] — a persist name must now be a plain identifier path

`#@ persist name=` accepts the table name a source materializes into, and that
value is pasted into the `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` and `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`
statements the builder runs. It was only ever checked for being _quoted_, never
for what the quotes contained, so a name carrying its own quote character closed
the identifier early and the rest of the value continued as SQL.

The accepted grammar is now dot-separated segments of letters, digits,
underscores and hyphens -- `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+(\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]+)*$`. That covers
every shape a table path takes today, including a hyphenated BigQuery project id
(`my-proj.mydataset.engaged_events`), a leading-digit segment, and a three-part
`project.dataset.table`. It is the same character set the control plane already
applies to physical names, so the two agree on what a name may contain. A value
with a quote, a backtick, a semicolon or a space is refused when the model loads,
with an error naming the annotation and the allowed shape.

To check a package without reading the diff: if every `#@ persist name=` value is
letters, digits, underscores, hyphens and dots, nothing changes for it.

A census of the packages we can see -- 438 persist annotations across 47
packages, 152 distinct names -- found none that this refuses, so no package that
loads today stops loading. The check exists because the value is author-supplied
input on a server that loads packages it did not write, not because a name in the
wild was doing this.

---

## [0.2.4] (BREAKING) — every MCP tool loses its `malloy_` prefix, and get_context answers in one shape

**Every MCP tool is renamed.** The `malloy_` prefix is gone and the names are bare
snake_case. There is no alias and no deprecation window: the old names are removed,
so an agent or client that calls them gets an unknown-tool error until it is updated.

| Before                        | Now                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `malloy_getContext`           | `get_context`            |
| `malloy_executeQuery`         | `execute_query`          |
| `malloy_compile`              | `compile_model`          |
| `malloy_reloadPackage`        | `reload_package`         |
| `malloy_getStatus`            | `get_status`             |
| `malloy_searchDatabaseSchema` | `search_database_schema` |
| `malloy_searchDocs`           | `search_malloy_docs`     |

**What to do.** Hosts that discover tools at connect time (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex)
pick the new names up on reconnect with no config change — the names appear in the
tool list, not in `.mcp.json`. Anything that hardcodes a tool name in a prompt, a
script, or a saved agent config has to be edited. The bundled skills and every doc in
this repo already use the new names.

**`get_context` also answers in a new response shape.** It used to return a flat ranked
`results[]` of entities; it now returns `sources[]`, where each source carries the
entities that matched inside it. A client that reads `results[0].name` finds nothing —
`results` is gone from every payload. An error payload keeps the empty collection of the
tool it came from: `sources: []` from `get_context`, `environments: []` from
`list_packages`, so a client can read either without branching on success first. Alongside the shape,
the response gained `below_cutoff_count`, `retrieval_reason`, `aliases`,
`givens`, `authorize`, `data_type`, `one_line_summary`, and `warnings[]` (which replaces
the single `note` string). The tool's own description is the contract and is pinned by a
test; re-read it rather than working from a cached copy.

**Duplicate rows are decided by the compiled model, not by names.** A field whose
whole definition is a reference to a sibling of the same source (`dimension: site is
SITE`) folds into it, reported in `aliases`. That used to be a guess from
name-humanization, which could not tell a rename from a derivation that happened to
look like one. And nothing folds ACROSS sources any more: two sources exposing a
same-named field are two different numbers, so each is returned under its own card
with its own `docs`, which is where the `where:` or grain rule that makes them differ
is written. Pass `include_code` to see a field's Malloy expression as `code`; off by
default.

**Listing the catalog is now its own tool, `list_packages`.** `malloy_getContext` with
no arguments used to list the environments; `get_context` requires its `search_targets`
and a `scopes` naming a package, so the catalog moved to a sibling tool that supplies
those names. Call `list_packages` first when you do not already know an environment and
package name.

Why now rather than behind an alias: no SDK surface exposes these names, and the
consumers that do use them (agents) re-read the tool list and the tool description on
every session, so a clean cut costs one reconnect where an alias would have left two
spellings in the docs indefinitely.

## [0.2.4] — bound the memory a LARGE DuckLake write spends holding Parquet

`PUBLISHER_DUCKLAKE_TARGET_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` caps how large a Parquet file DuckLake writes
before rotating to the next one. Unset, nothing changes: no option is set and the attach
issues exactly the SQL it issued before.

This is a **second, separate** term from the row group bound in 0.2.3 below, not a
replacement. The row group bounds the per-column buffer _within_ a file; this bounds how much
of the file is resident. Writing to object storage, DuckDB copies each multipart part into a
buffer it allocates itself and holds it until the file completes, so a file's bytes stay
resident however they are grouped inside it. Peak memory therefore tracks the FILE size —
and, like the row group buffers, is not bounded by `PUBLISHER_DUCKDB_MEMORY_LIMIT` at any
value.

Writing the same data to a local path does not do this; it streams. A deployment that
materializes to `s3://` or `gs://` pays a cost its local-disk testing will not show.

Measured on a 72-column, 20,000,000-row DuckLake write to GCS, sampling cgroup
`memory.stat` `anon` — all six cells in one batch, since this number moves with link speed
and with catalog state left by earlier runs:

| `PUBLISHER_DUCKLAKE_TARGET_FILE_SIZE_BYTES`  | files | peak anon |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----- | --------- |
| unset — DuckLake's own default, ~512MB files | 6     | 650 MiB   |
| `1024MB`                                     | 3     | 892 MiB   |
| `512MB`                                      | 6     | 550 MiB   |
| `256MB`                                      | 12    | 373 MiB   |
| `128MB`                                      | 23    | 262 MiB   |
| `64MB`                                       | 45    | 255 MiB   |

So the realistic gain is **650 → 373 MiB, about 1.74×** — DuckLake already rotates files, and
this option moves where it rotates. The underlying effect is much larger than that ratio
suggests: a plain single-file `COPY` of the same data measured 2979 MiB, against 149 MiB
writing to local disk, and S3 and GCS agreed within 0.1% (2976 vs 2979). But DuckLake never
writes the single file, so ~650 MiB is the baseline this option actually improves on.

Each bound alone leaves the other term unpaid. On one 5M-row write: row group only −18%,
file size only −34%, both −65%.

**Pick the LARGEST value that clears your memory ceiling, not the smallest.** Memory is the
only axis where smaller wins, and it stops improving below ~`128MB`. Everything else gets
worse: a full scan of the same data took 21.6s at `64MB` against 13.0s at `512MB`, the write
itself ran 70s against 42s, and the catalog carries one row per file per column — 3,240 rows
at `64MB` against 216 at `1024MB` for one 2.7 GiB table, in a catalog database every writer
of that lake shares. File-level pruning was already effective at every size tested, so the
small end buys nothing back on reads.

Same catalog mechanics as the row group bound: it persists in `ducklake_metadata`, is seen by
every writer of that lake, is skipped on a read-only attach, and a catalog that refuses it is
logged and attached anyway. It does **not** require `preserve_insertion_order=false`, and the
order the two options are applied in does not matter.

One consequence of persistence worth knowing before you tune: **unsetting the variable does not
revert the lake.** The last value written stays in `ducklake_metadata` for every writer of that
catalog. To go back, write the old value explicitly — `CALL <lake>.set_option('target_file_size',
'<value>')` — rather than removing the environment variable.

This is expected to be temporary. DuckDB's object-storage upload was reworked in
[duckdb-httpfs#389](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-httpfs/pull/389) to stream from buffers
the engine already owns rather than copying each part, which should remove the term this
option exists to bound. That work landed after the DuckDB version Publisher currently pins,
so until it ships in a release, this is the lever available.

## [0.2.4] — a pre-aggregation rollup can be built into and served from a storage destination

`storage=` now works on a `#@ preaggregate` line: the rollup is built into that
destination and served from it, and a query that names the base source is unchanged — it
still knows no rollup exists.

```malloy
source: orders is orders_pg.table('public.orders') extend {
  measure:
    #@ preaggregate grain="category" storage=lake
    total is amount.sum()
}
```

Before this the key parsed, passed validation, and did nothing: the reader took only
`grain` and `namespace`, nothing rejected the unknown key, and the rollup was built
alongside its base. No documented path reached it, which is why support arrives together
with refusals for the parts that are still not supported, rather than as two changes.

What is refused, and why each is a refusal rather than a silent choice:

- **`namespace=` with `storage=` on one line.** Placement inside a destination is
  derived, not authored — a freshly provisioned catalog has no schema to create the
  table in.
- **Two measures at one grain naming different destinations.** One grain is one table.

Two things that are NOT refusals, both of which read like they should be.

**A hidden field warns**, at publish and at load alike. A rollup stores its grain and each
measure's partial and is served under the base's name with none of the source's field
visibility applying, so the planner refuses to plan one at all — nothing is built and
nothing can be served. It warns rather than refusing because a package of that shape
published before the rule existed, and because the refusal was unfollowable: an annotation
inherited onto a source that then hides the measure raises it, while that source produces
no rollup and exposes nothing.

**Two grains on one base naming different destinations is dropped at serve, not refused at
publish.** Two grains are two tables, so nothing at publish has grounds to refuse what it
allows for `namespace=`. But a base's rollups are offered through ONE composite and every
member of a composite must live on one connection, so such a base serves from its rollups
not at all and its queries are answered from the base.

A destination is written on the `#@ preaggregate` line and is **not** inherited from the
base's `#@ persist storage=`, which stays as it was: a `storage=` base lends its rollups
nothing. Inheriting it would not work — a base that can carry that annotation builds a
stored table of its own, and a rollup over a stored base is built by reading that table,
along a path that recovers the rollup's definition from a model file it does not have. So
the build fails. Even had it succeeded, the base's own table already claims the name its
rollups would be served under.

With `PERSIST_STORAGE_MODE` off, a `storage=` rollup is not built — and not built
alongside its base either, which would put a table in your warehouse under a generated
name you never wrote. Queries are answered from the base and the package reports the
degraded state as a warning.

**Also changed for rollups that are not in a store.** Where several rollups cover one
query, the **coarsest** is now used. Members were previously ordered by generated name,
so with `grain="b"` and `grain="a, b"` a query grouping by `b` alone read the `a, b`
table because `a_b` sorts first. Grain dimensions are counted rather than measured, so
this is a proxy for size and not a reading of it. One consequence worth knowing: a rollup
is offered whether or not it has been built yet, so adding a coarse grain to a package
that already has a built finer rollup costs acceleration until the new one builds —
answers are unaffected, and it lasts one build.

## [0.2.3] — bound the memory a wide DuckLake write spends buffering Parquet

`PUBLISHER_DUCKLAKE_ROW_GROUP_SIZE_BYTES` caps how much column data DuckLake buffers
before it flushes a Parquet row group. Unset, nothing changes: no option is set and the
attach issues exactly the SQL it issued before.

Worth reading even if you do not plan to set it, because it corrects an assumption
`PUBLISHER_DUCKDB_MEMORY_LIMIT` invites. A DuckLake write buffers a whole row group **per
column**, so the memory it needs follows the table's WIDTH rather than its row count — and
those buffers sit outside DuckDB's buffer manager, so the memory limit does not bound them
at any value. A deployment sized on `memory_limit` alone is therefore sized on the wrong
axis: it survives long narrow materializations and is killed by short wide ones. The
symptom is a worker OOM-killed on one source while every other source in the same package
builds comfortably, with each DuckDB session reporting itself well inside its budget
throughout. If that is familiar, the source that killed it is almost certainly your widest.

Measured on a 72-column, 5,000,000-row `CREATE TABLE AS` into DuckLake, sampling cgroup
`memory.stat` `anon`:

| `PUBLISHER_DUCKLAKE_ROW_GROUP_SIZE_BYTES`  | peak anon | rows per row group |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| unset (DuckLake's default of 122,880 rows) | 2772 MiB  | ~122,880           |
| `64MB`                                     | 1530 MiB  | ~42,300            |
| `32MB`                                     | 1360 MiB  | ~21,900            |
| `16MB`                                     | 1006 MiB  | ~11,700            |

If you measure this yourself, read `anon` and not `memory.current`: the latter includes the
page cache of the Parquet being written, which scales with output size, roughly doubles the
apparent figure, and carries enough run-to-run variance to hide the effect entirely.

**Costs to know before adopting.** Smaller row groups are not free — more of them means more
Parquet metadata and coarser row-group pruning at read time, and only the write side of that
trade is measured here. Start at `32MB` rather than the smallest value that fits; go lower
only if a wide source still will not build.

The value is expressed in bytes rather than DuckLake's `parquet_row_group_size` row count on
purpose: one row count cannot suit a 9-column and a 110-column table at once, while a byte
budget derives rows-per-group from the data actually buffered and so tracks width as models
change.

Two mechanics that surprise people. It is applied as a **catalog** option, so it persists in
`ducklake_metadata` and is seen by every writer of that lake — Publisher skips it on a
read-only attach, and a catalog that refuses the option is logged and attached anyway. And
it requires `preserve_insertion_order=false`, which Publisher sets on the attaching session:
DuckLake plans its copy parallel unconditionally and does not preserve input order on these
writes regardless, so the guarantee being waived is not one that was being provided.
Measured on a 1.5M-row write from a sorted source: 15 adjacent inversions with the setting
on, 10 with it off.

## [0.2.2] — one materialized table, written once and readable by every source that shares it

Malloy [#3029](https://github.com/malloydata/malloy/pull/3029) settled that several sources naming one
physical table is the design, not a defect: `#@ persist` is inherited through `extend`, `extend` never
changes a source's materialization SQL, and `#@ -persist` is the opt-out. The publisher still assumed
one source owned one table. Two consequences, in opposite directions.

**A table was written more than once.** The build loop iterated per SOURCE, so it wrote a table once
per name that reached it, and once per graph that reached it. It now writes each physical table once,
keyed on the table's coordinate (destination-or-connection plus physical name) rather than on the
content address — the address says what a table contains, the coordinate says which table it is.

**An extension of a persisted source served LIVE instead of reading its base's table.** Serve
bindings are derived one per manifest entry and keyed on that entry's source name, and an entry names
only the source that built the table — so of a base and its extension, exactly one was bound and the
other silently recomputed, decided by build order. Every source sharing the table is now bound, on one
virtual handle. The colocated tier was never affected: it substitutes through the same-connection
manifest, which is keyed by content address.

Two definitions with DIFFERENT content landing on one physical table is the same guard read backwards:
each build overwrites the other's rows while both addresses resolve to the table at serve time. That is
reported, and refused when `PERSIST_COLLISION_ENFORCE` is set — **before anything is written**, since a
refusal that lands mid-build leaves the first table already replaced and no reclaim can restore the
rows it overwrote.

### New metrics

| `publisher_materialization_shared_address_instructions_total` | One content address instructed to build more than one table.

| `publisher_materialization_table_collision_total`             | Two definitions materializing into one table — serve-time wrong data. **This is the one to alert on.** Its rate is also what enabling `PERSIST_COLLISION_ENFORCE` would begin refusing, so a rollout can be measured before it is turned on. |

## [0.2.2] — a boolean query param you misspell now fails instead of doing nothing

`reload`, `dropTables` and `bypass_filters` were each read as `=== "true"`, so
every other spelling — `?reload=1`, `?dropTables=yes`, `?reload=TRUE`, or the
parameter repeated — quietly read as `false`. The request then succeeded while
doing nothing of what it asked.

The worst of the three was `dropTables`. `DELETE
…/materializations/{id}?dropTables=1` deleted the materialization record, left
its physical tables on disk, and answered `204 No Content`, so nothing in the
response said half the operation had been skipped. `reload=1` on a package cost
callers more often: they edited a model, saw `200`, and queried the model the
server had never recompiled.

All three now accept only `true` and `false` — the two spellings `api-doc.yaml`
already declared — and refuse anything else with `400`, quoting the value back
and naming a form that works. `bypass_filters` was already declared in the spec
as an enum of exactly those two, so this makes the server match its own
contract.

Separately, `reload` on a **collection** route (`GET /environments`,
`GET …/packages`, and their legacy `/projects` twins) now answers `400` naming
the per-resource route. Reload recompiles one named resource, so a collection
never could; it used to answer `200` with the list, which reads as a reload that
worked.

**Who is affected.** Anyone sending a non-`true`/`false` value to these three
params, or sending `reload` to a collection route, gets a `400` where they used
to get success. Every such request was already a silent no-op, so no working
behaviour changes — but a client that ignored the response body and trusted the
status will now see the failure it was previously missing. Generated clients
send real booleans and are unaffected. `api-doc.yaml` now documents the `400` on
each of these routes.

## [0.2.0] — a colocated persist into a non-default schema now lands there (ACTION REQUIRED)

A colocated `#@ persist name=` that names a container — `name="analytics.orders"`
rather than `name="orders"` — was materialized into the connection's **default**
container instead, on Snowflake and MySQL.

The build finishes by staging a table and renaming it into place, and it named the
rename target by its bare table name. Snowflake and MySQL resolve an unqualified
rename target against the session's current container, so the table was created in
the right place and then moved to the wrong one. Two ways it showed up:

- **Silently.** The build reported success and the manifest recorded
  `analytics.orders`, while the table sat in the default container. Anything
  serving that source then resolved a path holding no table.
- **As a nonsense error.** `Object '"orders"' already exists` when something of
  that name was already in the default container — while `analytics` was empty.

The rename target is now qualified on the dialects that resolve a bare one against
the session (Snowflake, MySQL, Trino) and stays bare on those that reject a
qualified one (Postgres, DuckDB, BigQuery).

**Action required.** Tables built before this release from a container-qualified
colocated persist name are in the default container, with manifests pointing at a
path that holds nothing. Upgrading does not move them. Rebuild those sources — a
forced refresh or a republish — so the table is written where the name says. The
strays in the default container are not referenced by any manifest and can be
dropped once the rebuild is confirmed.

Unaffected: `storage=` sources (a different write path), colocated sources whose
`name=` carries no container, and every dialect other than the three above.

## [0.2.0] — every DuckDB session is now bounded

DuckDB sizes its `memory_limit` from the container, at roughly 80%, and it does that **independently per instance**. Publisher runs several instances in one process — the metadata store, a serve-shape gate session, the environment lookup funnel, a sandbox per loaded package, and a disposable session for each materialization build — and none of them accounts for the resident runtime baseline or for any of the others. Measured in a 3 GiB container, three instances each reported a 2.3 GiB limit: 6.9 GiB of committed budget against 3 GiB of real memory. The process is then killed by the kernel while every instance still believes it is comfortably inside its budget, so none of them looks at fault and the growth presents as untracked native memory.

Two new settings, `PUBLISHER_DUCKDB_MEMORY_LIMIT` and `PUBLISHER_DUCKDB_TEMP_DIRECTORY`, both **opt-in and no-ops when unset**, so nothing changes on upgrade. The limit is a flat absolute value rather than a share: Publisher cannot compute one, because the number of live instances is not known when a session opens and revising the division as instances appear would shrink a live cap underneath a running query. [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) has the sizing guidance — the divisor is not a number of builds — and the reasoning behind both.

Unset now logs a startup warning naming the condition, so the oversubscription is discoverable without reading this file.

One thing worth knowing before tuning: setting a `memory_limit` does **not** by itself introduce spill on the `storage=` build path. That pipeline pushes its SQL to the source warehouse and streams the result into the destination, with nothing to spill — measured at a flat peak across a 30× range of output, with zero bytes written to the temp directory at any limit, including one tight enough to fail. An over-tight limit fails the query and leaves the process up, which is the intended trade against losing the pod.

## [0.2.1] — a versioned dashboard URI is now honoured

`<Dashboard>` accepted a `?versionId=` in its `resourceUri` and dropped it. It now sends it, on the
manifest fetch, on each tile's query, and on each control's suggest query, and each is cached per
version. `<Package>`'s dashboards listing sends it too, and a notebook's suggest queries — shared
code, and the only part of `<Notebook>` that was still unversioned while its own fetch and its cell
execution were not.

Omit `versionId` and nothing is sent, so a URI without one behaves exactly as before. **Point a
versioned URI at Publisher and the page now reports an error where it used to render the latest**:
Publisher answers `501 Not Implemented` to a `versionId` on every route that declares one, and
these calls no longer hide it. That is the same contract `<Notebook>` and `<Model>` have always
had, and it is why the components are useful to a host that resolves versions at its own routing
layer. See [docs/dashboards.md](docs/dashboards.md#rendering-one-in-your-own-react-app).

The in-package HTML data apps stay unversioned, deliberately: `/data-apps` serves static files and
declares no `versionId`.

---

## [0.2.1] — one way to build a dashboard, and per-tile layout for it (BREAKING)

A Publisher dashboard is `## artifact { tiles=[…] }`. The `# artifact` on a `query:` still works and
is still served, but it is no longer offered as a second way to build one: it is a rendered Malloy
query, the same thing a notebook cell shows, and it cannot span sources because a nest's pipeline
starts from its own query's source.

Two things changed to make that one form sufficient.

**Per-tile layout.** The per-child dashboard tags on the view a tile names are now read by Publisher
and applied in its own grid: `# colspan=N`, `# break`, `# subtitle`, `# borderless` and `# label`,
which is the whole set `@malloydata/render` resolves for a `# dashboard` nest child, validated and
clamped the same way. So one view presents identically whether it is named as a tile or nested under
a query, and a dashboard is no longer limited to equal-width tiles. `DashboardTile` on the wire gains
`label`, `subtitle`, `colspan`, `break` and `borderless`, each spelled the way the tag is (a generated
client escapes the attribute where the word is reserved, so the Python client exposes `break_`, while
the wire key stays `break`).

**One spelling of the grid width. `dashboard_columns` is gone.** Write
`# dashboard { columns=N }` beside the artifact tag, on either form:

```malloy
## artifact { title="Overview" tiles=["overview -> kpis", "overview -> trend"] } dashboard { columns=12 }
```

Nothing reads `dashboard_columns` any more, so a package still spelling it lays out at the default
width. That is not silent: a new lint enumerates the artifact tag and names every property Publisher
does not read, `dashboard_columns` included, with the spelling to use instead. It also catches a
misspelling and a `tiles=` on a query-level tag, neither of which was reported before — the reader
looks properties up by name, so an unrecognised one was simply never asked for.

`DashboardManifest.dashboardColumns` therefore narrows on a tiles-form dashboard: it now reflects
only `# dashboard { columns=N }`. Downstream artifacts spelling `dashboard_columns=2`, which equals
the viewer's default, do not visibly move, but their lint output changes.

This is also where Publisher stops being byte-compatible with Malloyyo, which reads
`dashboard_columns`. That is one property and it is deliberate — the render tag already covers a
tagged `query:`, so one spelling covers both forms — and the docs that claimed byte-compatibility now
say so. `docs/malloyyo-dashboards-design.md` §Where Publisher diverges is the record, and the
divergence is an input to the shared-grammar extraction rather than a settled thing.

`examples/storefront/dashboards/overview.malloy` is the first dashboard the bundled examples ship,
and it is the same figures as the model's `business_overview` view laid out with these tags.

---

## [0.2.0] — `#(authorize)` is an expression on the `source:` line now, not a quoted string (BREAKING)

This is the headline change of this release, and it supersedes every earlier section on this page
that shows `#(authorize) "<expr>"` on a `source:` line — including the `[0.0.248]` and `[0.0.205]`
sections below, which describe the syntax as it was when they shipped. **That syntax no longer
loads.** A gate is now an unquoted, natural Malloy boolean expression, carried by an `#(authorize)`
annotation on its own line directly above the `source:` line it gates:

```malloy
##! experimental.givens

given:
  ROLE :: string

#(authorize) $ROLE = 'analyst'
source: orders is duckdb.table('orders.parquet') extend {
  measure: order_count is count()
}
```

### What breaks

- **The string form is refused at model load.** Any `#(authorize) "<expr>"` on a `source:` line
  fails the load with **HTTP 424**, and the message names each offending source and expression and
  tells you the rewrite: drop the quotes and keep the annotation on its own line above `source:`.
  **Every existing gated package must be rewritten**; there is no compatibility mode and no flag.
- **`##(authorize)` (file-level) is refused at load** as well, including one folded in from an
  imported file. Declare `#(authorize)` on each source it was meant to protect.
- **`#(authorize)` anywhere other than directly on a `source:` line is refused at load** — on a
  `dimension:`/`measure:`/`join_*:`/`view:` line inside a source, or on a top-level `query:`. A gate
  only applies where model load looks for one: a source's own annotation, or one it inherits from an
  `extend`/query-source base.
- **A source may declare at most one `#(authorize)` annotation.** Stacking two on one source to mean
  OR is gone — a second annotation fails the load naming both. Write the disjunction out inside the
  single expression (`$ROLE = 'admin' or $TENANT = 'acme'`).

### What is validated, and what only warns

Refusals fail the whole model load (424, naming the source):

- **G1** — the annotation's payload must compile as a boolean expression.
- **G4** — every given the expression references must be declared with **no default**, wherever it
  appears in the expression — including one reached through a bare field reference
  (`#(authorize) authorized` over `dimension: authorized is $ROLE = 'analyst'`). An unsupplied given
  would otherwise resolve to its default and admit or exclude rows the gate did not mean to.

There is no separate load-time G3 check: a given the expression references that is off the model's
own given surface fails to compile the gate's own probe query, and Malloy's own error covers it. The
`unreachable_given` rejection cause still exists for the request-time resolver, which sees references
the load-time probe could not (see the membership-operand fix below).

Warnings load fine and are counted on `publisher_authorize_row_level_rejected_total`:

- **W1** (`source_line_gate_no_given_reference`) — the expression references no given at all, so it
  is a fixed predicate rather than a rule keyed on the caller. Deliberate for a locked base
  (`#(authorize) false`); worth a look otherwise.
- **W2** (`source_line_gate_negated_membership`) — a negated membership test
  (`not (org_id in $GROUPS)`). It loads and filters correctly for a non-empty given, but an **empty**
  given then matches every row instead of none. Best-effort shape match: other spellings of the same
  inversion do not trigger it, so its absence is no evidence either way.

There is no accepted-shape allowlist any more. The string form validated its expression against a
small grammar of comparison shapes before it could be attached, so `upper(region) = $REGION`,
`region like $PAT`, `region is not null` and `amount + 1 > $AMOUNTMIN` were all refused at load; all
four are legal gates today. The trade is one case that used to be a named load-time refusal and is
now a request-time warehouse error: comparing a row field to an array-typed given with `=`/`!=`
(`org_id = $GROUPS`) loads and grafts cleanly and fails when the warehouse executes the cast. Use
`in` for an array-typed given.

### A derivation can no longer silently shed a gate

An intermediate form of this feature put the gate on an annotated boolean dimension inside the
source's body. It is also refused at load, and this is why: a derivation could drop that dimension —
`extend { except: authorized }`, or an `accept:` that just did not re-list it — and produce a source
with **no gate at all**, serving **every row to every caller**, with no load error and no warning.
Malloy's compiled IR keeps no link from an `extend`-derived struct back to its base, so nothing could
refuse the load over it.

A source-line expression has no field to shed. A derivation that drops a column the gate **reads**
leaves the grafted filter unable to compile, so that entry point is **denied** rather than served
ungated. The load succeeds, and a warning names the entry point whose gate is no longer expressible
so you find out before a caller does.

One narrower hole replaces it, and is worth knowing while you migrate: drop the gated column and then
`rename:` a _different_ column onto that exact name. That grafts successfully and binds the gate to
the **wrong** column. It takes a drop, plus a rename onto the exact gated name, plus colliding data,
and it fails closed unless the data collides — but do not recycle a gated column's name.

### Migrating

1. Find every `#(authorize) "<expr>"` and `##(authorize)` in your packages. Load the package — every
   `.malloy` file in the tree compiles and any failure aborts the load, so the refusal will name
   each declaring source. The one case that escapes it is a declaring file _outside_ the package
   tree: nothing compiles it, so it loads and then denies every request — and it increments no
   metric, since the request-time lift failure carries no `cause` at all. That gate is invisible
   except in a debug log naming the graft target, so grep your packages rather than waiting for a
   signal.
2. Paste the rewrite: drop the quotes, and put the annotation and the `source:` line it gates
   directly adjacent, e.g. `#(authorize) $ROLE = 'analyst'` above `source: orders is …`.
3. Collapse stacked annotations into one `or` expression.
4. Read the load warnings. A derivation that narrows away a column the gate reads now denies at that
   entry point rather than leaking, and the warning is where that shows up.

See [docs/authorize.md](docs/authorize.md) for the full reference, and
[docs/authorize.md § Enforcement](docs/authorize.md#enforcement) for the per-route behaviour
(notably: `/compile` admits any gate that references no given, whichever way it resolves, so a
constant-`false` lock does not hold there and `includeSql` returns the ungrafted SQL).

### Also fixed

- **An unsupplied gate given no longer leaks its name.** A gate's givens bind with the query's, so
  Malloy's own failure named the one that could not bind — "Given 'ROLE' has no value and no default.
  To fix: supply it via `.run({givens: {ROLE: ...}})`" — reaching the caller as a 400. That is exactly
  what `docs/authorize.md` promises never happens. It now maps back to the opaque `Access denied for
source "…"` 403.
- **A membership test checks given reachability on both operands.** The membership _candidate_
  position skipped the check every other operand position makes, so a gate naming a given two import
  hops away bound that given's declaration **default** at request time instead of the caller's value.
  It is now refused (`unreachable_given`) like every other unreachable reference.
- **A documented gate example was never valid Malloy.** `$ROLE in ['analyst', 'admin']` fails to
  compile — a list literal is not valid in that position. Write the disjunction out
  (`$ROLE = 'analyst' or $ROLE = 'admin'`), or compare a row field to an array-typed given with `in`.
- **`/compile` no longer denies a gated source unconditionally.** Denying it made a gated source
  un-authorable while protecting nothing, since the query path answers a gated source with _filtered
  rows_ rather than a 403. `/compile` never runs the query, so it now admits a gate it can decide
  without running one. **"Decidable" is presence, not truth:** a gate referencing no given is
  admitted whichever way it resolves — a constant `false` included — as is one whose every given the
  caller supplied, right or wrong. Only an unsupplied given denies. `includeSql` then returns the
  **ungrafted** SQL, without the gate's `where:`, so treat `/compile` as a schema/SQL surface that a
  `false` lock does not close. `/compile` at scope `append` still denies a gated source outright: the
  run target's `SourceDef` belongs to the virtual model, so there is no graft target there.

`docs/authorize.md` is reconciled with all of the above.

## [0.2.0] — a proven row-level `#(authorize)` gate can now be colocated-persisted

This supersedes the "A colocated `#@ persist` on an `#(authorize)`-gated source is now REFUSED" bullet
further down this file, before that section has even shipped: unconditional refusal is no longer the
whole story. A colocated `#@ persist` (no `storage=`) is now ELIGIBLE when the compiler can prove the
gate is the entry point's own row-level filter and nothing else is reachable beneath it
(`classification: "row_level", attributed: true`) — every other shape (unattributed/join-only,
`rejected`, or no outcome at all) still refuses exactly as before. `storage=` and `#@ preaggregate`
are unaffected; they remain unconditionally refused for any `#(authorize)`-gated source regardless of
classification. See [docs/materialization.md](docs/materialization.md#authorize-gated-sources-and-materialization).

**This ships unconditionally — there is no flag.** The migration it causes is worth reading before you
upgrade. The refusal being relaxed never fired at package _load_; it fired inside the build path
(`deriveSelfInstructions` / `executeInstructedBuild`). A package with a colocated `#@ persist` on an
`#(authorize)`-gated source therefore already loads, appears in `plan.sources`, and serves live — what
422'd was its materialization run. So such packages already exist, and upgrading changes them: a run
that used to fail succeeds, and the next auto-run or scheduled build materializes the source and binds
it for serving **with no author action**. A source that served live yesterday serves from a
possibly-stale artifact afterwards, subject to the staleness below.

**What this does NOT make fresh: the row data the gate filters on, not the gate itself.** The gate
expression and the querying principal's attributes are still evaluated live, every query, against the
persisted table. Only the values in the gating column are frozen at build time, so a row whose access
decision changes (say, it changes owner) keeps serving to its former owner until the next rebuild.
Bound that with `materialization.freshness` `{ "window": …, "fallback": "live" }`: the serve path
re-evaluates freshness per query, so a stale artifact drops out of the serving set and the query
recomputes live whether or not a rebuild lands. A cadence alone is not a bound (a failed build or a
stopped scheduler serves the old decisions indefinitely), and `refresh="incremental"` is not one
either — its delta is bounded by the watermark, so a row that changes owner without its watermark
advancing is never re-read. Only a full rebuild recomputes the gate column. See
[docs/materialization.md § freshness contract](docs/materialization.md#the-freshness-contract-for-a-gated-colocated-persist-source).

## [0.2.0] — `BuildPlan.refusedSources`, and a materialization-ordering fix

**`BuildPlan` gains a `refusedSources` collection**, alongside the existing `sources` map, so a host can tell
"this package declares no persist source" from "every persist source was refused". It is a SEPARATE
collection rather than a field on `PersistSourcePlan`: constructing that plan entry calls `getSQL()` and
computes the source's content address, and a free-parameter or given-referencing source cannot reliably
survive those calls, so a refused source needs a wire shape that requires neither. Each entry carries the
source's name/sourceID/modelPath, which tier it was evaluated against (`storage` or `colocated` — the SAME
tier the build path itself would use, post the colocated row-level relaxation; see below for the later-added
`preaggregate` tier), the bounded refusal reason,
and the full refusal message. No new reason was added to the existing `free_parameter | given | authorize |
not_duckdb_portable | public_surface_unknown` enum; the two compile-time asserts this collection is computed
from can only ever produce the first three.

**Fixed: one refused, uninstructed persist source used to abort an entire orchestrated build.** The build
loop checked a source's eligibility before checking whether the caller had actually instructed it, so a
package with several persist sources — one refused, and never instructed, alongside others the caller DID
instruct — threw on the refused one and lost every source in the run, not just the one that could not build.
An uninstructed source is now skipped without an eligibility check; an instructed refused source still 422s
exactly as before.

**Also added: `SourceFailure.connectionName` / `SourceFailure.storageDestinationName`.** A consuming service
resolving a failure-only source's destination (to release a destination-scoped claim) had no discriminator
to key on and would default to colocated even for a `storage=` source that failed a rebuild — a live claim
leak on a partially-successful run. Both fields mirror their `ManifestEntry` counterparts, so a consumer
computes the same destination key (`storageDestinationName ?? connectionName`) whether the source built or
failed. **This must land before the deprecated `ManifestEntry.error`/`entries`-mirror-for-failures removal**
(see that field's own deprecation note) — a consumer still reading failures off the `entries` mirror gets
neither field until it moves to `BuildManifest.failures`.

Also added a routing-outcome label, `blocked_by_row_level_gate`, on `publisher_storage_serve_routing_total` —
previously a row-level-gated entry point that vetoed both the storage and pre-aggregation tiers recorded no
routing outcome at all.

## [0.2.0] — a gated `#@ preaggregate` rollup now reports its own refusal

`BuildPlan.refusedSources` gains a `preaggregate` tier. A gated rollup's pre-aggregation gate refuses
unconditionally when its base is `#(authorize)`-gated (rollups group away the gate column, so there is
no row-level admission the way colocated has), and that refusal was previously invisible: the rollup
still appears in `sources` (synthesis is unaffected by the gate — see the `refusedSources` entry above),
but nothing said it would never materialize. Such a rollup now also appears in `refusedSources` with
`tier: "preaggregate"` and `reason: "authorize"`, alongside its `sources` entry — the one tier where
appearing in both maps at once is the correct, intended state, unlike `storage`/`colocated` where a
refusal means absence from `sources`. A host inspecting the plan can now tell a gated rollup will 422 on
instruction before instructing it.

## [0.2.0] — every `#(authorize)` gate is a row filter now, not just a field-referencing one (BREAKING)

This supersedes the "a gate that references only givens is unaffected" line in the section below, before
that section has even shipped: there is no longer a separate given-only shape. A gate that reads no row
field — `$ROLE = 'analyst'`, `$LEVEL > 3`, a bare `true`/`false` — used to be evaluated by a
one-row DuckDB probe with a whole-source admit/deny answer. It now classifies and enforces exactly like a
row-level gate: the condition becomes a constant `where:` (`true` admits every row, `false` matches none),
and everything in between resolves the same as before this whole redesign started. Classification now has
only two outcomes, `row_level` and `rejected` — `given_only` is gone.

### The breaking change

- **A gate whose verdict used to deny now returns 200 with zero rows, not 403** — for the query path. A
  caller supplying `ROLE: 'intern'` against a gate of `$ROLE = 'analyst'` gets an empty result instead
  of `AccessDeniedError`. Check any consumer that keys logic on the 403 status for this class of gate; the
  correct row-level equivalent is checking for zero rows.
- **Package-level FGA denials are unaffected — still 403.** `can_read_package` and every other
  organization/workspace access check remain exactly as they were; only a gate's _own_ verdict moved to
  filtering. Do not conflate the two: a package a caller cannot read at all still never reaches the gate.
- **`/compile` now denies a row-level gate unconditionally, whether or not the given satisfies it.**
  Superseded — see the `/compile` bullet in the section at the top of this page. It now
  admits any gate it can decide without running the query, which includes every gate that references
  no given at all.
- **A negated scalar comparison (`not ($ROLE = 'blocked')`) is now an accepted gate atom.** It was
  previously reachable only because a field-less condition skipped the row-level grammar entirely; now that
  every gate goes through it, negating a single comparison is explicitly supported (equivalent to
  flipping the operator). A negated **membership test** (`not (x in $GROUPS)`) is **also** accepted,
  with a **W2 load warning** rather than a refusal — there is no accepted-shape grammar any more, so
  nothing classifies expression shape at load time. The emptying-the-set hazard is real and is what
  the warning is for: an empty given makes the negation true for every row instead of none.

### Known, accepted narrowing: the "no schema oracle" guarantee is smaller

The early, pre-compile gate could previously deny a given-only mismatch synchronously, before the caller's
own query ever compiled — so a bad field name on a locked source came back as 403, never as a Malloy
compile error naming the field. Every gate is now enforced via a compiled backstop (a graft onto a
recompiled query), so a caller's own malformed query (an unknown field, a type error) can surface its
compile error before the gate ever gets a chance to deny. This is accepted, not fixed: no query ever
executes either way, so no row data leaks — only whether a field name is recognized, which was already the
case for a genuinely row-level gate before this change.

### Fixed: `/compile` gate-stripping bypass

`/compile`'s **`file`/`append`-scope backstop** used to discover a run target's own gate by walking the
_caller's own compiled struct_, not the on-disk model's. A caller who submitted edited text with the
`#(authorize)` annotation stripped could evade that backstop entirely for a row-level-classified gate — the
early, best-effort check (`assertAuthorizedForText`) that DOES read the authoritative on-disk annotation
only _deferred_ a row-level classification rather than denying, so nothing downstream re-checked it against
the on-disk source of truth. This was closed for a given-only gate before the row-filter collapse above
(the early check denied it synchronously, no struct needed); it was not closed for a row-level one.
`Model.collectAuthorizeEntryPointGates` now folds `entryPointGatesBySource` — computed once from this
model's own on-disk `modelDef`, which caller text cannot edit — into the struct walk's result, so a gate
the caller stripped from submitted text is still found and still denies.

---

## [0.0.250] — opt-in request rate limiting

The REST server can now cap how many requests one client makes per minute: set `PUBLISHER_RATE_LIMIT=<n>` and the `n+1`th request in a minute from the same peer address gets a `429` with standard `RateLimit-*` headers. It is off unless set, so nothing changes for an existing deployment. Health probes and `/metrics` are exempt, and the MCP port is not covered. Behind a reverse proxy every client arrives from the proxy's address and would share one bucket, so rate-limit at the proxy in that deployment instead. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

Also in this release, the SDK's filter UI escapes backslashes in string values before quotes rather than after, so a value containing a backslash no longer reaches Malloy double-escaped.

## [0.0.249] — a filtered aggregate can be pre-aggregated

Since 0.0.246, a measure filtering its aggregate — `paid is amount.sum() { where: is_paying }` — was refused at publish by `#@ preaggregate`, with the workaround of rewriting it as `amount.sum(pick amount when is_paying else null)`-style expressions or filtering in a view. The refusal was the fail-closed gate doing its job, not a soundness limit: the rollup computes each stored partial from the measure by name, so the filter rides into the build, and a row-level filter commutes with merging per-grain partials — filtering then merging equals filtering the whole, for every merge the feature hands out, including `count`'s (a filtered count stores a count of matching rows and still merges with `sum`).

So the gate now accepts a filter **written directly on the measure's single aggregate** (several conditions comma-separated in one `where:`), and nothing else changed shape: a filter refining a derived measure, an aggregate wrapped in a further expression (`coalesce(amount.sum() { where: … }, 0)`), a chained refinement (`{ where: a } { where: b }` — use the comma form instead), or a non-scalar condition is refused exactly as before. A filtered `avg` is still refused as `avg`. No action needed on existing packages — this only admits annotations that previously failed publish — but measures rewritten around the old refusal can return to the plain filtered form, which now also pre-aggregates.

One caution in the rollback direction: the publish gate is also a load gate, and it is package-level. A package that adopts `#@ preaggregate` on a filtered aggregate loads only on servers carrying this change — roll a server back past it and that package does not merely lose its rollup, it fails to load entirely and drops into `loadErrors`. Inherent to any gate widening, but worth knowing before adopting the new shape in a fleet that pins older images.

## [0.0.248] — `#(authorize)` can gate rows, not just the whole source (BREAKING)

> **Syntax note (added later):** every `#(authorize) "<expr>"` sample below is the string form, which
> is what shipped in 0.0.248. It is **retired and refused at model load** as of the dimension-form
> section at the top of this page — read that for the current syntax before copying anything here.

A gate whose expression reads no row field works exactly as before; a gate that reads one — its
own source's, or a joined source's — now filters rows instead of only admitting or rejecting the
whole source. This ships on, unconditionally — there is no flag to stage the rollout.

### Breaking changes, in the order they bite

- **A denied caller now gets 200 with zero rows instead of 403**, for a row-level gate.
  `#(authorize) "org_id in $GROUPS"` and `#(authorize) "childtable.name = $BOB"` are now valid — the
  join a joined-field gate needs is compiled in as part of the entry source's own build, before any
  caller-controlled query stage exists. This cannot affect an existing package: a row-field gate
  could not be written before this ships (it always failed the one-row probe, which has no real
  columns for it to read), so no existing caller can be relying on the 403. It matters for gates
  authors write from now on — check any consumer that keys logic on the 403 status. See
  [docs/security-posture.md](docs/security-posture.md).
- **A colocated `#@ persist` on an `#(authorize)`-gated source is now REFUSED** — superseded by the
  relaxation in the section above this one, which admits exactly the proven `row_level` + attributed
  shape; every other shape still refuses as described below. This DOES break
  existing packages — one that has this will fail to build where it previously succeeded — so it is
  worth being precise about what it does and does not close. It is **not** closing an unfiltered
  leak: measured, a colocated substitution replaces only the source's relation SQL, while the gate
  is applied as the reading query's own `WHERE`, so the two compose and rows come back filtered.
  What it refuses is authorization decided against a **frozen** copy of the gating column. The
  artifact is built once; a row whose `org_id` changes in the warehouse keeps being served to its
  old owner and stays hidden from its new one. Nor does adding a gate refresh anything — the
  content address does not include the annotation, so a pre-gate artifact stays addressable
  indefinitely while every rebuild is refused. Note also that the check's reach is deliberately
  wider than that: it also refuses a source that merely _joins_ a gated source, which entry-point
  semantics never enforced anyway. Drop `#@ persist` from the source, or move the gate to a source
  that is not materialized. See [docs/materialization.md](docs/materialization.md).
- **An `#(authorize)` in a position nothing enforces now fails the model load** — a top-level
  `query:` statement, or a field (`dimension:`/`measure:`/`view:`) inside a source. This also
  breaks existing packages, also deliberately: today such a gate silently protects nothing. Move
  the annotation to the `source:` statement it is meant to protect.
- **An `#(authorize)` on a `join_one:`/`join_many:` line fails the load, in the common case.**
  Gating a join has no effect, so this is the same misplacement as the bullet above and is refused
  the same way — move it to the joined source's own `source:` declaration. The one exception is a
  join whose target is declared beyond what this model imported (a selective one-hop import of only
  the joiner, or a source two-plus hops away): there the annotation is indistinguishable from
  Malloy's own by-reference copy of the joined source's gate, so it is ignored silently rather than
  risk refusing a correct package.
- **`##(authorize)` (file-level) is deprecated and now fails the model load.** It was a mistake to
  ship a model-wide override in the first place: the raw-warehouse path it existed to close is
  already closed unconditionally by restricted mode, so the file-level fallback protected nothing a
  source-level gate couldn't already cover, while being easy to misuse into unlocking every source
  in a file at once. A `##(authorize)` annotation anywhere in the model — including one folded in
  from an imported file — now fails the load rather than silently applying; the remedy is
  `#(authorize)` on each `source:` it was meant to protect. See
  [docs/authorize.md § Declaring Gates](docs/authorize.md#declaring-gates).
- **A near-miss `authorize` spelling now fails the model load instead of silently doing nothing.**
  `# (authorize)` / `## (authorize)` (a space after the `#`), `#( authorize )`, `#(authorize )`,
  `#(authorize)X`, `#authorize`, and case variants of the name itself (`#(AUTHORIZE)`,
  `#(Authorize)`) are not `authorize` annotations to the Malloy compiler — the spaced pair are plain
  MOTLY/render tags, the next four are malformed prefixes, and the case variants route to a name that
  is not ours — so a source carrying one has always served every row while its author read it as
  locked, and the package loaded clean. A package with one of these will now fail to load, naming the
  spelling and the fix (`#(authorize) "<expression>"` on the `source:` statement). Refusing is
  deliberate rather than interpreting the intent: honouring the spelling would mean publisher
  assigning meaning inside a namespace Malloy reserves for itself, and would silently start enforcing
  a filter on packages that served every row yesterday. In the same change, the block form
  `#|(authorize)` … `|#` and the other bracket pairs (`#[authorize]`, `#<authorize>`, `#{authorize}`)
  are now recognized as gates, because the compiler routes them there — the block form in particular
  was previously a live fail-open, unenforced at query time _and_ eligible to be frozen into a
  materialized artifact.

  **What is deliberately NOT refused:** another application's `authorize`-prefixed route.
  Classification now asks the compiler for a note's route rather than matching its text, so
  `#(authorize-v2)`, `#(authorize.audit)`, `#(authorize/v2)`, `#(authorize_v2)` and `#(authorized)`
  are valid distinct routes belonging to whoever declared them, and load untouched. An earlier draft
  of this refusal matched them as near misses and failed the whole model load with advice aimed at
  someone else.

- **Known limitation — one notebook shape fails with a 400 instead of filtering.** A cell that both
  declares a gated source and runs it in the same cell, where the gate reads a JOINED field and the
  run query does not itself reference that field, is refused rather than answered. Reference the
  joined field in the run query's own projection to avoid it. Never a leak — no rows are returned
  either way, and the 400 is only the wrong status for a request that should have succeeded with
  filtered rows. Every other same-cell shape (the first code cell, one preceded only by markdown, or
  any later cell) filters correctly.

### What changed

- **A gate that references only givens is unaffected.** Most existing gates are this kind. They
  keep the one-row DuckDB probe and the whole-source admit/deny decision unchanged.
- **The accepted row-level shape is a restricted, positive allowlist**, and anything outside it —
  including a given that isn't on the model's own given surface — is refused at package load,
  naming the reason. A broken gate never serves. For exactly what is accepted and refused, and
  why, see [docs/authorize.md § Row-level gates](docs/authorize.md#row-level-gates).

### Author-facing behavior worth knowing

- A gate on a joined field turns a `join_one` LEFT JOIN into an INNER JOIN — a parent row with no
  matching child drops out rather than surviving with nulls.
- A gate must resolve at every entry point the declaring source is reached through, and an entry
  point where it cannot is closed rather than opened. `rename:`, `except:`, and `accept:` can remove
  the field a gate was written against. Where the entry point declares its **own** gate, package
  load fails with a 424 naming the source; where it only **inherits** one, load succeeds with a
  warning and that entry point denies every request, leaving the rest of the model serving.
- Entry-point-only semantics are unchanged: a gate on a source reached only through a join still
  does not fire. A gate may now _reference_ a joined field from the entry point's own expression —
  that is not the same thing.

## [0.0.247] — a build that loses one source keeps the rest

A build that failed on any source abandoned the whole command: it stopped at the first failure, reclaimed the tables already written, and reported one message for the entire run. A package where one source of five had a bad grant was indistinguishable from a package that was entirely broken, and the four tables that had already materialized were dropped on the way out.

A source that fails is now recorded in the manifest with the reason it gave, and the build continues. The sources that materialized stay usable, and a consumer can tell which source failed rather than inferring it from an absent entry. A build that loses _every_ source still fails — it produced nothing, so it must not report itself as a success with errors attached. A reuse-only run, which builds nothing of its own, is unaffected.

**New response field.** `BuildManifest.failures` maps a sourceEntityId to a `SourceFailure` carrying `reason`, redacted against that source's own connection. A consumer generating a strict client from `api-doc.yaml` rejects the field until it regenerates; the key is absent on a run where every source built.

Failures are reported _beside_ `entries` rather than inside one, which is the part worth knowing if you consume a manifest. A failure carries the `physicalTableName` the source was headed for — useful for correlating with the request, and never a table to read: the build that would have created it is what failed, and a failed _rebuild_ leaves the prior generation in place under that same name, so resolving it serves stale data rather than nothing.

**`ManifestEntry.error` is deprecated.** 0.0.245 and 0.0.246 report a failed source as an entry carrying `error`, and that remains true for one more deprecation cycle: a failure is written to **both** `failures` and a mirrored entry, so a consumer reading `error` keeps working unchanged. Move to `failures` — `error` will be removed, and once it is, `entries` holds only sources that built.

Until then a consumer that resolves an entry to a table must skip entries whose `error` is set. This is not hypothetical for stored manifests either: one committed by 0.0.245 or 0.0.246 on a partially-failed build records the failed source inside `entries` with a `physicalTableName` that was never created, and that state survives an upgrade. This build drops such entries where a persisted manifest is read back (serve rebind, reuse, reference resolution) rather than binding the name.

**New metric label values.** `outcome` on the run counter gains `partial`, for a run that committed a manifest while some of its sources failed; the sources counter gains `failed`. A success-rate expression written as `success / (success + failed)` now drops `partial` into neither bucket, so a partial failure reads as a dip in volume rather than a failure. Alerting on that ratio should add `partial` to the denominator, or to the numerator's complement, depending on whether a partially served package counts as healthy for that deployment.

**One existing label value changes meaning.** `outcome="built"` on the sources counter is counted from what the build returned, where before this release it was the length of the instruction list. An instruction can be skipped without building — an incremental source whose boundary already covers the requested range, or one with no matching compiled source — and the old count reported those as built. The new figure is lower by however many a run skips, so a deployment trending `built` will see a step change at upgrade that is a correction rather than a drop in work done. The change came with the partial-failure work above; it is called out here because the counter itself predates it.

## [0.0.246] — measures can be pre-aggregated

A measure annotated `#@ preaggregate grain="…"` is rolled up into a stored table at that grain, and a query the rollup covers reads the small table instead of the base. Queries name the original source and nothing about them changes; the rollup is selected behind it, or bypassed, with a per-query fallback to live for anything no rollup covers.

[docs/preaggregation.md](docs/preaggregation.md) is the guide. Two limits to know before reaching for it, both of which cost acceleration and not correctness. **A query that names a `view:` does not route:** rollups are offered through a composite source, which carries its members' fields but not their views, so `run: orders -> by_category` serves live while the same query written out reads the rollup — which covers the REST `queryName` form and Console dashboards. **A query that supplies a `given:` does not route** either, since a model-level given does not cross into the synthesized model; that one is partly inherent, because a rollup is built with the givens in force at build time and could not answer a different value from stored rows anyway. Between them, a workload of named views or a filter-driven data app sees little benefit today.

**The annotation is all it takes — there is no deployment flag to enable.** Writing one is the decision to build and serve a rollup, so a package that carries no `#@ preaggregate` is untouched: nothing extra is planned, built, or compiled for it. Worth knowing before adding your first annotation, because the build is not free: a rollup is materialized like any `#@ persist` source, and a grain whose cardinality approaches the base table's spends nearly as much as the base while saving little. `buildPlan.sources` with `origin: preaggregate` is where to see what a package will build before it builds it.

**A measure may be declared at several grains, one annotation line each, and that is a cost decision.** A rollup also serves queries grouped by any _subset_ of its grain, so one rollup at `category, order_day` correctly answers by-category, by-day and grand-total queries. But a combined grain has roughly the product of its dimensions' cardinalities, so `customer_id, order_day` can approach the base table's row count and save almost nothing where either grain alone is small. Declaring both separately gives each query a small table to read, at the price of two tables to build and refresh. Rollups are grouped by grain, not by measure: ten measures sharing a grain are one table and one `GROUP BY`. Note that where two declared grains both cover a query, the one used is the first in the composite's member order, which is by generated name rather than by size — so grains are worth declaring for queries they cover _differently_, not to offer the same query a choice.

**Unusable annotations are refused at publish, and again at load.** Pre-aggregation's failure mode is an annotation that silently does nothing while the plan looks correct, so anything that cannot be built is a 400 rather than a warning. Refused: an annotation anywhere but on a measure; a measure whose aggregate cannot be re-aggregated from a stored partial (only `sum`, `count`, `min` and `max` can — pre-aggregate a sum and a count and divide them in a view instead); a grain naming anything but a dimension the source itself declares, which rules out an inline truncation like `grain="order_time.day"` (declare `dimension: order_day is order_time.day` and name that, after which coarser truncations of it route too); and a base source with a fan-out join, since `join_many` and `join_cross` can multiply rows. A `join_one` is permitted, and a measure that aggregates through one is served normally. Enforcing at load as well as at publish matters because re-aggregatability is derived from the compiled model: a Malloy version change can in principle reclassify a measure that published cleanly, and that surfaces as a package that stops loading (reported in `ServerStatus.loadErrors`) rather than one quietly paying for rollups that answer nothing.

**API.** `PersistSourcePlan` gains `origin` (`persist` for a `#@ persist` the modeler wrote, `preaggregate` for a rollup the publisher synthesized) and `preaggregate`, a `PreaggregatePlan` naming the base source, the grain's dimensions, and the measures served at it. A synthesized rollup is declared by no file, so it reports the model holding the annotations it came from, which is where an author would go to change it. Nothing about a synthesized rollup appears in model discovery: the author's model is never edited, so it still exports the source it always did.

## [0.0.245] — `publisher.db` picks up new columns on upgrade

An existing `publisher.db` has always picked up a new **table** added by a later build, because `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is idempotent. It never picked up a new **column**: that same statement is a no-op against a table that already exists, however its columns differ. So a store created before a column was introduced never gained it, schema initialization reported success anyway, and the first write naming that column failed at the binder.

**If your `publisher.db` predates 2026-06-19, every `POST .../materializations` has been returning 500** with `Binder Error: Table "materializations" does not have a column with name "manifest"`. That store now repairs itself on the next boot. Materialization is the only thing that was affected; nothing else names the column.

### What changed

- **Schema init now reconciles columns.** After the `CREATE TABLE` pass, the declared shape is compared against what is on disk and anything declared-but-absent is added. Additions only, and only for columns carrying no constraint. A declared `DEFAULT` **is** carried across and backfills existing rows.
- **What it cannot fix, it now says at boot.** A constrained column that cannot be added, or a column already present whose type, nullability, default or constraints have changed, is logged as a warning naming the column, instead of surfacing later as a binder error on an unrelated request. This is the part that keeps earning its keep after this particular column is behind us.
- **Nothing is ever dropped.** Columns and tables an older store has and this build no longer declares are left in place and reported at debug level. `materializations.build_plan` (added and removed within four days in June 2026) and the `build_manifests` table are both inert relics of this kind; removing them is a decision for an operator, not something an upgrade should do quietly.

### What is and is not carried across

`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` in DuckDB rejects a column carrying any constraint — `NOT NULL`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `FOREIGN KEY` — with or without a `DEFAULT`. A bare `DEFAULT` is accepted. So the safe subset is not a policy this code chose; it is the boundary the engine enforces.

Constraints are read from `duckdb_constraints()` rather than inferred from nullability, which matters more than it sounds: a `UNIQUE` or `CHECK` column reports as _nullable_, so screening on nullability alone would add it as a bare column and leave the store holding the right column under the wrong rules — two servers on the same build enforcing differently depending on how their store was created. Such a column is refused and named in the warning instead.

A future column outside the safe subset needs a hand-written step, and the boot warning is what tells you the day one appears.

Constraints are also now compared on columns both sides already have, and reported the same way. A constraint added to an existing table's DDL is as invisible to `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` as a column is, and the consequence is quieter: the older store keeps accepting rows a fresh one rejects, with nothing failing to say so.

There is still no schema-version marker, and none is needed: the comparison is against the database itself. The expected shape is not written down twice either — it is read back from a scratch in-memory database the same DDL has just been run against, so the `CREATE TABLE` statements remain the single declaration of the schema.

### On a large store

Adding a column without a default is a catalog operation, not a data rewrite — on a 5M-row, 205MB `materializations` table it took 17ms and grew the file by 0.1%. Adding one **with** a `DEFAULT` backfills every existing row, so that path is a real write: ~81ms on the same table, with a longer checkpoint. Both are trivial against a boot that compiles packages, and both happen before the server accepts traffic, but only the first is free.

### Why it took an upgrade to find

CI starts from a clean checkout with no `publisher.db`, so the create path always runs with the current DDL and the drift cannot arise. The gap was never a missing assertion — it was that no test had ever booted against a store older than the build. There is one now.

---

## [0.0.244] — a `storage=` build's warehouse read is now attributable

A `storage=` build reads its source through DuckDB's native query-passthrough, where no Malloy connector is in the call path to apply the query-metadata bag. Every such build therefore reached the warehouse untagged — the one kind of work a deployment could not attribute. It now carries the same bag the colocated path does, resolved through the same layering.

**Snowflake** takes it as a session `QUERY_TAG`; its read is unchanged. **BigQuery** takes it as `@@query_label`, which it cannot do without splitting the read: `bigquery_query()` accepts no labels parameter and cannot run the script that would set one. So a labelled BigQuery read runs as `bigquery_execute` over a two-statement script, and the anonymous result table that job wrote is then read with `bigquery_scan`. Reading that table goes through the Storage Read API and creates no new query job, so the split is not a second scan. **Postgres** has no per-statement tag and is unaffected.

**New operational prerequisite on BigQuery.** A labelled read locates its result table by listing the executed script's child job, an API surface the unsplit read never touched. A connection that cannot list its own jobs keeps the read it had before and loses attribution rather than its build — the fallback is decided by a probe issued _before_ anything runs, and counted by `publisher_storage_build_attribution_skipped_total`. Separately, and independent of tagging, the passthrough streams its results over the Storage Read API on every path: `bigquery.readsessions.create` (`roles/bigquery.readSessionUser`) is a standing requirement for materializing any BigQuery source into a storage destination.

`ManifestEntry.queryCostBytes` is populated for a tagged `storage=` build, and the full per-engine cost — billed bytes, slot or execution time, the cache flag, the warehouse's own job ids — goes to the build's log line.

---

## [0.0.250]: an incremental refresh can advance a `storage=` table

`refresh="incremental"` alongside `storage=` was a publish rejection. It is now supported, with the
same declarations and the same guarantees as a colocated incremental source: the table is advanced by
a bounded `[covered_through, frontier)` delta instead of being rebuilt.

### What changed

- **The delta spans the two engines the tier already spans.** The source warehouse computes the
  bounded range — the predicate is pushed into its own query, so it never streams rows that will be
  discarded — and the `DELETE`+`INSERT` (or `MERGE`, for a `merge_key=` source) is applied in one
  DuckLake transaction against the stored table. The table is either at the old snapshot or the new
  one; the read-only serving attach sees the new one on its next query, with no re-attach.
- **A delta's warehouse read is attributed and costed** exactly as a full build's is, through the same
  call: a `queryMetadata` bag reaches it as a BigQuery `@@query_label` or a Snowflake `QUERY_TAG`, and
  `ManifestEntry.queryCostBytes` reports what a tagged read cost. Refresh spend on this tier was
  otherwise the one kind of warehouse work a deployment could not account for.
- **`LedgerEntry` gains `storageDestinationName`.** A boundary belongs to a table, and where a stored
  table LIVES is not implied by the connection whose SQL computes it — `storage=` enters neither the
  content address nor the physical name, so nothing else distinguishes a boundary measured on the
  stored table from one measured on a colocated table of the same name. A caller holding the ledger
  should store and return it like every other field. One that does not yet: an entry without it, for a
  source this run materializes into a destination, is treated as stale and the source seeds — it is
  not rejected.
- **A CHAINED stored source still rebuilds** every refresh, reported under its own reason code
  (`chained_storage`) rather than silently. Its parent's own delta can restate rows below the child's
  frontier, where no delta of the child's would revisit them.
- **`publisher_source_build_duration_seconds` gains a `delta_storage` engine label**, kept apart from
  `delta` for the same reason `storage` is kept apart from `in_warehouse`: the two have different cost
  profiles and pooling them averages one into the other.

### Upgrading

**Every incremental source rebuilds once.** A boundary is now keyed by the store its table lives in
as well as by the connection and the name, because a source persisted colocated and one persisted
into a destination under the same name are two different tables that coexist legitimately — sharing
one row made both seed forever, each overwriting the other. `publisher.db` re-keys the ledger on
boot and discards the recorded boundaries with it, so each incremental source takes one full rebuild
and then resumes advancing by delta. Same mechanism, and the same one-time cost, as the re-key in
0.0.240.

**If you hold the ledger yourself, store the new field before you upgrade.** An entry returned
without `storageDestinationName` for a source materialized into a destination describes a different
table, so that source seeds — every run, not once, until the caller round-trips it. That is
deliberate (an entry from a caller that predates the field is stale, not wrong, so it is not
rejected) but the only signal is a repeating `no_boundary`. Update the caller's ledger storage first,
or accept full rebuilds until you do.

**A source that was rejected for declaring both keys now publishes**, and takes the same one rebuild
as any other incremental source before it starts advancing.

## [0.0.249]: a given's control contract is read off its own tags

The `Given` control contract shipped in 0.0.242 as a schema with no reader: the fields were declared and no endpoint populated them. The server now derives them from the declaration's own tags, so they are populated wherever a `Given` is returned.

### What changed

- **`label`, `control`, `rangeMin`, `rangeMax` and `suggest` are now populated,** read from the `given:` declaration's own plain-`#` tags. How a given should be presented belongs to the given rather than to any one surface, which is what lets a notebook, a dashboard and an SDK host render the same control without restating it. Those tags sit in Malloy's reserved namespace and are dropped from `annotations`, so deriving them server-side is what lets a client read them without shipping a MOTLY parser of its own. A declaration carrying none of the tags carries none of the fields, and a value the contract does not accept (`control=radio`, a non-numeric bound) is dropped the same way rather than reported.
- **`Given` gains `description`,** helper text read from a `# description=` tag. This does not replace `#(description="…")`, which still works and is still what the notebook UI renders: that form stays on `annotations`, where the client that parses it today keeps finding it. The tag form is the one that compiles without a `malformed-route` warning, since Malloy reads an annotation's route up to the first whitespace and a multi-word `#(description="…")` therefore is not well formed. Nothing renders the new field yet.

## [0.0.249]: the Console says what this server can do

The home page described a three-feature Publisher, the package page gave four of its six kinds of
content the same colour, and Publisher's in-repo reference docs had nothing linking to them.

### What changed

- **Six feature cards on the home page instead of three**, covering notebooks, dashboards, data apps,
  the MCP endpoint, ad-hoc analysis and the governance model, each linking the reference doc for it.
  The card previously titled "Notebook dashboards" named a compound of the two surfaces it straddled rather than either of them, and
  linked the publishing setup guide. A closing paragraph names connections, materialized tables and
  the REST API, which have docs but do not earn a card.
- **`DOC_LINKS` gains a `REPO_DOCS` block**, six links to Publisher's own reference docs, which live
  in the repo rather than on the docs site and for several features are the only write-up there is.
  A spec checks each target exists in the repo, case-sensitively, so a doc renamed, deleted or
  mistyped fails the test suite rather than shipping a broken card. It cannot check that a target is
  on `main` yet, which is a merge-ordering question: this change was sequenced behind the dashboards
  slice for exactly that reason, and that slice has since landed.
- **`docs/choosing-a-surface.md`**, a comparison of notebooks, dashboards and HTML data apps with a
  decision guide. `docs/malloyyo-dashboards-design.md` has referenced it since it merged; it now
  exists.
- **Every content type on the package page has its own icon and its own colour.** Four of the six
  rows had been passing the same teal from four separate call sites, so colour distinguished two
  kinds out of six. The row now derives both from one `type` prop, which is why it cannot drift
  again. The three added colours each clear WCAG's 3:1 against white, measured, since they sit behind
  a white glyph.
- **`Add Connection` is a contained button with an icon**, matching the add-triggers on the home
  and environment screens. It was the only one of the three still outlined.

### For SDK consumers

Additive only. `DOC_LINKS` is a public export (`src/index.ts`) and gains six keys; none of the
existing four changed. Everything else here is internal: `PackageItemRow` is a file-local function
whose props changed, and `ContentTypeIcon`, `ContentType`, `CONTENT_TINT` and `MALLOY_ACCENT` are
not re-exported from `components/index.ts` or `src/index.ts`, so they are not on the published
surface at all.

## [0.0.244] — queries report how they were served, and what they cost

The server measured several things and then discarded them, and the query
histogram carried two labels that grew without bound. Both are addressed.

### What changed

- **`malloy_model_query_duration` no longer labels by query text or row count.** Both are unbounded — ad-hoc text yields a new series per distinct query, a row count one per distinct result size — and a histogram label multiplies by the bucket count, so the metric grew for as long as a process served traffic. On one deployment serving real traffic the query-text label alone carried ~637 distinct values across ~14.9k series for this histogram. They remain on the request log. `environment` and `package` take their place: the only identity on the metric was previously a bare model path, which is not unique across packages.
- **`malloy_model_query_duration` now spans execution, not just preparation.** The timer stopped before the warehouse round trip, so the histogram excluded the one part its own description ("how long it takes to execute a Malloy model query") named. It now covers compile, authorize, routing, prepare and execution. **Expect every existing p95 panel to step up at deploy** — that is the metric starting to measure what it always claimed, not a regression.
- **`QueryResult` gains `servedFrom`, `executionTimeMs` and `queryCostBytes`.** A storage-served answer is byte-identical to a live one, so `servedFrom` is the only way a caller can tell a materialized source did anything; `live_fallback` is reported separately from `storage` because it is a success answered by the live warehouse, and counting it as a hit would report a healthy hit rate for a broken store. `queryCostBytes` comes from `runStats`, which the BigQuery connector already populated and nothing read.
- **`ManifestEntry` gains `buildDurationMs` and `queryCostBytes`.** The duration was already measured for the build histogram and sent upward as null.
- **`malloy_model_query_scanned_bytes`**, a counter of bytes scanned by served queries, where the backend reports them — BigQuery today.

### Reading the cost numbers

**Bytes scanned is not bytes billed.** BigQuery rounds up to a 10MB minimum per query, so a small read bills an order of magnitude above what it scanned — and materialization refreshes are mostly small reads. Every figure reported here is SCANNED. Use it to compare queries against each other; it is not a spend number.

**Null is not zero, and on the build side which paths report differs.** `ManifestEntry.queryCostBytes` is populated for a COLOCATED build, from the Malloy connection's own statistics. An incremental delta reports null because its statements do not run through a single call whose result reaches the manifest, and a chained `storage=` build reports null because it read its parent's already-materialized table and touched no warehouse at all.

A plain `storage=` build reports a figure when its warehouse read carried query metadata, and null otherwise — see the attribution section above for what makes the difference. A Postgres source reports null on every path, since the label that makes a read reportable is BigQuery's.

On the serve side, check `servedFrom` before reading a null as "free": a `storage`-served query touched no warehouse, while a Snowflake or Postgres query touched one and simply reported nothing.

### For consumers generating clients from this spec

`QueryResult` and `ManifestEntry` both gain fields. Strict generated clients reject unknown properties — openapi-generator's Java/Gson `validateJsonElement` throws on any field absent from the client's `openapiFields` — so a consumer running this server against a client generated from an older spec fails at deserialize on every affected response. **Regenerate clients in the same change as the version bump**, not after it.

## [0.0.243] — `storage=` builds from a Snowflake source now work (Docker image)

The 0.0.236 notes below list `snowflake_query` among the native query-passthroughs a `storage=` source is materialized through. That was true of the code and never true of the published image: **materializing a Snowflake source into a storage destination has not worked at all.** Two independent faults, both fixed.

### What changed

- **The image now carries the ADBC Snowflake driver.** The Snowflake extension is a wrapper over it, and `INSTALL snowflake FROM community` does not bring it — so every `snowflake_query()` failed at run time with `ADBC Snowflake driver (libadbc_driver_snowflake.so) not found`. It is now fetched at a pinned version, for the image's architecture, into the extension directory the runtime reads.
- **A key-pair Snowflake connection can be federated.** The passthrough required a password and emitted `PASSWORD`, so a connection authenticating by key pair — which queries fine on the live path — could not be built from at all. Key pair or password is now accepted, with a private-key passphrase when supplied.
- **`ROLE` and `SCHEMA` travel with the federated connection.** Both are part of what identifies a Malloy connection; without them a build ran under the user's _default_ role while live queries on the same connection used the configured one.

### Why it went unnoticed

Both guards were blind for the same reason. The image build verified Snowflake with `SELECT snowflake_version()` — a scalar that never touches the driver and passes without it — and the offline extension smoke test asserted only that extensions `LOAD`. The driver is a query-time dependency, so nothing that ran at build time could see it missing.

### Scope, and what is still missing

The driver is installed by the **Docker image**. A local clone or `npx @malloy-publisher/server` still has no driver, so `storage=` builds from Snowflake continue to fail there with the same error — installing it is a manual step (`dbc install snowflake`, or the extension's installer script). Closing that properly means the bake step owning the driver alongside the extensions, which is worth doing and is not this change.

### Operational notes

A failed driver fetch now **fails the image build** rather than warning and continuing. An image without the driver cannot answer a Snowflake query, so it should not leave the builder reporting success — which is how this shipped. A release built from an unchecked ref is covered by the same assertion, since it lives in the Dockerfile rather than only in CI.

## [0.0.236] — DuckDB/DuckLake materialization tier (`storage=`)

This section describes the tier as it stands at 0.0.236. It first shipped in 0.0.232; the disjoint-set semantics between `storageDestinations` and `connections` landed in 0.0.236.

A `#@ persist` source can now be materialized into a **storage destination** — a DuckLake declared in the environment's `storageDestinations`, a disjoint set from `connections` — instead of its own warehouse, and served back from that materialized table cross-dialect, with no model change. Off by default; see [docs/persist-storage-tutorial.md](docs/persist-storage-tutorial.md).

### What changed

- **`storageDestinations`**, a per-environment list declared alongside `connections`, holds the warehouses a `storage=` source is materialized into and served from. It is a disjoint set: a destination is not resolvable by name from a model, a notebook cell, or query text, is absent from the connection endpoints (404), and its name is independent of the connection namespace — so the same name may appear in both lists and mean two different warehouses. Only the build and materialized-serve paths resolve one. Writing the list is all-or-nothing: a create or update carrying a value that is not a list of usable destinations is refused with 400 naming every defect and applies none of it, so a destination the server could not read is never silently left unregistered; an unusable entry in the config file, or in a row restored at boot, is instead dropped with a warning so one bad entry cannot take an environment offline. See [docs/connections.md](docs/connections.md#storage-destinations).
- **`#@ persist storage=<destination>`** materializes a source into that storage destination via native per-engine query-passthrough (`postgres_query`/`bigquery_query`/`snowflake_query`); absent or `storage=source` is the unchanged in-warehouse path. The reserved connection name `source` is rejected at registration.
- **`PERSIST_STORAGE_MODE`** deployment switch (`off` default | `write-only` | `on`): a kill switch that ships dark — `off` is a no-op, and moving it down never fails a loaded package (a `storage=` source reverts to serving live and surfaces a package warning). See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).
- **Serve from storage:** when `on`, a query against a materialized source is served from the stored table via a virtual-source transform (its dimensions, measures, materialized-target joins, and views re-declared over the stored columns); anything not reproducible falls back to serving live, so turning it on can never make a query wrong.
- **Physical tables named by `name=` verbatim.** The auto-run server names a `storage=` table by its `#@ persist name=` value (or the source name) verbatim — exactly as the in-warehouse path does — and a rebuild atomically replaces it in place (DuckLake's catalog swap is transactional). No hashed suffix, no coexisting generations, and no operator convenience view. Assigning distinct physical names per generation (for immutable generations, safe schema evolution, or rollback) is the caller's responsibility on the orchestrated build path, where the caller supplies `physicalTableName` and distributes serve bindings via `manifestLocation`. `DELETE …/materializations/{id}?dropTables=true` reclaims a storage table (destination-aware drop).
- **Chained sources reuse the parent.** A `storage=` source that reads another `storage=` source in the same destination is built by **reading the parent's materialized table** (rolled up in DuckDB), so it reuses the parent's work and is consistent-by-construction. If it can't (a parent field that isn't a stored column, a live join, or a cross-destination parent) it falls back to recomputing the upstream from raw — refused instead under `strictUpstreams`. Reported by `publisher_storage_chained_build_total{outcome}`.
- **Eligibility gate (HTTP 422 / failed build):** a `storage=` source with an unbound free parameter, a given reference (a security refusal — a frozen given-filtered table would leak rows across tenants), or a non-DuckDB-portable served shape is refused. A source protected by `#(authorize)` should also not be materialized (the served shape carries no gate); that refusal lands alongside the upstream transitive-`#(authorize)` enforcement it reuses — until then, serve authorize-gated sources live.
- **Connection type `ducklake`** (catalog + `bucketUrl` storage) — see [docs/connections.md](docs/connections.md).
- **Observability:** `storageServeBindings` on package status; `publisher_storage_serve_routing_total{outcome=storage|live_fallback|runtime_live_fallback}`, `publisher_storage_chained_build_total{outcome=parent_reuse|inline_fallback|strict_refused|infra_failure}`, and a `served_from=storage|live_fallback` attribute on `malloy_model_query_duration`, plus build/GC/eligibility counters under the `publisher` meter. `runtime_live_fallback` is the signal that the tier is broken while queries still succeed — the hit rate alone won't show it.
- **A run-time store failure honours `freshnessFallback=live`.** If a routed query fails against the stored table (a reclaimed generation a binding hasn't caught up with), a source whose binding declares `live` is recomputed live rather than erroring — the same answer the compile-time fallback ladder already gives. `fail` and the `stale_ok` default keep surfacing the error, and the decision is read from the bindings actually serving the query, so a stale sibling can't veto it.

### Operational notes

- **Multi-replica serving via the manifest.** A `storage=` source can be served across a fleet by carrying its serve binding in the same manifest the publisher already fetches from a package's `manifestLocation`: a manifest entry that names a `storageDestinationName` (with the captured `schema` and `sourceName`) binds as a cross-connection serve binding applied to the already-compiled models (no recompile); entries without it remain same-connection `tableName` substitutions (which do recompile). A refresh is the usual manifest-rebind — rewrite the manifest and re-`PATCH` `manifestLocation` — and a storage-only refresh costs no recompile. Entries are keyed by the build's content `sourceEntityId` (= the serve handle), so a freshness refresh keeps the handle and only swaps the table path, while a schema-changing generation gets a new handle. Standalone (no `manifestLocation`), serve bindings are still re-derived per-replica from the local materialization store on package load; run that single-replica. When a `manifestLocation` is set the host is authoritative and the local-store rebind is skipped, so the two binding sources never fight.
- **Roll back cleanly.** Deleting a package's materializations before rolling back to a publisher version without this tier avoids a wedge: an older build reuses/binds a persisted `storage=` manifest entry as a same-connection table it can't resolve. Building with `storage=` only ever affects deployments that turned the mode on.

## [0.0.249]: shared given and drill controls, and the notebook adopts them

The control layer behind `given:` is now one implementation instead of one per surface: state, URL encoding, `suggest`-backed pickers, and `# drill` click handling all live in the SDK, and `Notebook` is the first surface built on them. A notebook's parameters are now part of its URL, so a filtered notebook is a link you can send.

This is a **breaking release for SDK consumers**: five removals and one narrowed prop type, all listed under Migration.

### What changed

- **A notebook's parameters live in its URL.** `Notebook` takes `givens` and `onGivensChange`, and the Console wires them to the query string. Opening a notebook at `?REGION=West` runs every cell with that value on the first pass rather than running bare and running again. The host is handed the names the notebook manages alongside the values, so it can update its own query string without disturbing parameters that are not its business.
- **`# drill { to=self }` works in a notebook cell.** A cell that groups by a dimension carrying the tag becomes clickable and filters the notebook in place with the clicked value, provided the notebook declares the given the tag names: one that names a given the document does not declare stays plain rather than offering a click that cannot be honoured. Drillable cells read as links on hover, via a new mode-keyed `drillLink` theme colour. Two cases are deliberately left unmarked: a blank cell, whose click is refused anyway (a blank value is far likelier a misclick than a request for the rows that are blank), and every cell of a `# transpose` table, because the renderer lays that layout out without the per-cell `grid-column` the marking matches on. A transposed table's drill still WORKS when clicked; it is undiscoverable, which is the one place on this surface where the affordance and the behaviour disagree. A drill naming a _dashboard_ destination is honoured too, now that the dashboard route exists: the cell is marked, and clicking it opens that dashboard with the value seeded. On a host that has not wired the navigation the destination stays unmarked and inert rather than painting a cell as a link to a page that answers "Nothing to open at this path".
- **`select` / `multiselect` controls backed by `suggest`.** The option list comes from an ordinary query on the governed query endpoint, so row caps and `#(authorize)` gates apply to a dropdown exactly as they do to the surface's own queries. A suggest query that fails now says so on the control instead of rendering as a dimension with no values, and the generated query carries an explicit `limit:` and ordering rather than relying on the server's default row cap to truncate it in whatever order the warehouse returned.
- **Filter values are escaped by Malloy's own filter package.** A `filter<…>` value picked in a control is now printed with `@malloydata/malloy-filter`'s `StringFilterExpression.unparse`, and read back with its parser. The previous scheme wrapped values in double quotes, which Malloy's string-filter grammar has no notion of: backslash is its only escape, so the quoting escaped nothing and several ordinary values silently meant something else. Measured against the `storefront` model, filtering its `category` dimension: a picked `-Outerwear` ran as a negation and returned 22,821 of 25,356 rows instead of the 2,535 that category holds; `%` bypassed the filter and returned all 25,356; `null` hit the null operator and returned 0; and `Ben & Jerry, Inc` was read as two brands. All of these now match themselves, pinned by a round-trip test against the real parser.
- **The notebook's controls are `given:` only.** The Filters panel that rendered `#(filter)` and `##(filters)` annotations is gone, and the notebook no longer sends `filterParams`. **This is a behaviour change for a model that uses `#(filter)`, and the deprecation note under 0.0.201 said otherwise.** Concretely: a cell fails when its run target is a source that declares a `required` filter, because the server still refuses one with no value and there is no longer a UI that can supply it. That is narrower than "every cell" in two ways worth knowing before you audit a model: enforcement is per run-target source, so cells querying a source with no filters are unaffected, and a **block-form** `#(filter) … required` is not collected at all, so it never raised the error in the first place (`source_extraction.ts` documents that gap deliberately). A model with only optional `#(filter)` annotations still runs, but is no longer filterable from the notebook. The REST parameters, the `Deprecation` header, and the server-side enforcement are all unchanged: this is the UI half of the migration landing ahead of the server half. Migrate to `given:`: [docs/givens.md](docs/givens.md) has a **"Coming from `#(filter)`"** section with a worked conversion and the three things that do not map across.
- **A cell that cannot run says why.** A failed cell used to log to the console and render as blank space, which was survivable while only a server fault could reach it. The server's own message is now shown on the cell.
- **A superseded run is cancelled, and a burst of edits only runs once.** Changing a control while a run is in flight starts a new one, and the old run's requests are aborted rather than left to complete and have their results discarded. A changed value also waits 400ms to settle before anything is dispatched, so typing into a text control runs the notebook once rather than once per keystroke. Aborting alone was not enough: it cancels the request, but cells already sent are still compiling and running on the warehouse, and their answers are thrown away.
- **Reset means "back to where this document starts".** It restores the document's declared starting values and re-runs once. It previously cleared the controls to empty and, depending on `autorun`, either did nothing at all or ran the queries twice on the way back to the starting values.

### Migration

- **`useGivensForm` and `UseGivensFormResult` are removed.** Use `useGivensState`, which additionally covers URL round-tripping and Apply batching. `GivenValue` is still exported from the package root, but see the next entry.
- **`GivenValue` no longer includes `string[]` or `number[]`.** It is now `string | number | boolean | Date | null`. The array members promised something the new URL codec cannot deliver: `givenToParam` joined a list on `,` with no escaping and `paramToGiven` never returns an array for any type, so a list did not survive the round trip, and a value containing a comma could not even be split back to the right number of entries (`["Ben & Jerry, Inc", "Nike"]` became the single string `Ben & Jerry, Inc,Nike`). Nothing in the SDK produced an array value, so this narrows a promise rather than removing a working feature. Multi-value parameters are expressed today with a `filter<…>` given, whose values are escaped by Malloy's own filter package. Code annotated `GivenValue` that holds a list will stop compiling; hold the filter string instead.
- **`Notebook`'s `onNavigate` takes a narrower event.** The signature is now `(to: string, event?: NavigationClick) => void`, where `NavigationClick` is `Pick<MouseEvent, "metaKey" | "ctrlKey" | "shiftKey" | "button">`. A `# drill` click arrives from the Malloy renderer as a DOM event rather than a React synthetic one, and this is the subset both satisfy. Function parameters are contravariant under `strictFunctionTypes`, so **an existing handler annotated `(to: string, event?: React.MouseEvent)` stops compiling** with TS2322. Widen the annotation to `NavigationClick` (exported from the package root), or drop the annotation and let it be inferred.
- **`Notebook`'s and `Package`'s `retrievalFn` props are removed**, along with the semantic-search filter they fed. `RetrievalFunction` and `DimensionFilter` are still exported for consumers rendering their own filter UI.
- **`RenderedResult`'s `onDrill` prop is replaced by `drill`.** `onDrill` was an untyped `(element: unknown) => void` handed straight to the renderer's `onClick`; `drill` is a `DrillBinding` (`{onClick, canDrill}`), which is what lets a result both handle a `# drill` click and mark the cells it applies to. `RenderedResult` is exported from the package root, so a consumer passing `onDrill` loses drill handling silently: the prop is simply not read any more. Build the binding with `useDrill` and pass it as `drill`, or pass `{onClick: yourHandler, canDrill: () => false}` to keep the old click-only behaviour with no affordance.
- **`@malloydata/malloy-filter` is a new peer dependency** (`^0.0.427`). It is already in the dependency tree of `@malloydata/malloy-explorer` and `@malloydata/malloy-query-builder`, both existing peers, so an install that satisfies the current peers already has it.
- `GivensPanel` and `GivenInput` are now exported from the package root, and `GivensPanel`'s `onClearAll` prop is `onReset`: a rename with no compatibility concern, since neither component was reachable from the package root before this release.
- **`ResolvedTheme` gains a required `drillLink` field.** It is the hover colour for a drillable cell, keyed by mode. `ResolvedTheme` is an output type: you get one from `resolveTheme` or from the theme context, so reading it is unaffected. Only code that hand-constructs a `ResolvedTheme` literal (a test fixture, say) needs the extra field. The input type, `Theme`, is unchanged.
- **`ResultsDialog` accepts a `drill` prop.** Additive. A notebook cell now passes it, so a result stays clickable when it is expanded rather than only inline.

## [0.0.242]: one meaning for `givens` across the API

`givens` had come to mean four different things: declarations, typed values, string-encoded values, and a bare list of names. It now always means a collection of `Given` declarations, and the other three have names of their own. Renames and spec corrections only; no endpoint changes what it does.

### What changed

- **`Givens` is renamed `GivenValues`,** and the string-encoded form that survives a URL is a new named `EncodedGivenValues`. `Givens` read as the plural of `Given` and was not: `Given` describes what a model _accepts_ and is always carried in a plain array, while these two are the values a caller _sends_, decoded and string-encoded respectively. No field, shape, or wire format changed on any endpoint, but **the symbol rename is breaking for a generated client that names it**, so regenerate before upgrading. Which clients those are depends on the generator, and the two we run disagree: `openapi-typescript` (our server types) emits a named `Givens` and now emits `GivenValues` and `EncodedGivenValues` instead, and the Python generator likewise emits `given_values.py` and `encoded_given_values.py` in place of `givens.py`. The axios generator behind `@malloy-publisher/sdk` inlines the map and names nothing, so an SDK consumer is unaffected.
- **`Given` now carries the control contract** wherever it is returned: `label`, `control`, `rangeMin`, `rangeMax`, and `suggest` (a new `GivenSuggest`), all optional. How a given should be presented belongs to the given rather than to any one surface, which is what lets two surfaces render the same control without restating it. The server does not populate them yet; this release lands the contract so the readers that follow have one place to write to.
- **Package warnings name their subject `subject` rather than `target`.** `target` meant the opposite of a `# drill` target: it named where a finding sits, not where anything points. Every producer feeding `Package.warnings` now uses the new key, including the materialization-config findings, whose own `MaterializationConfigWarning` type carried the old one.
- **`RawNotebook` declares what the notebook endpoint actually returns.** `type`, `modelPath`, `modelInfo`, and `queries` are on every response and were undeclared, which forced a blanket cast in the server that would have accepted a stale field name after a rename. `resource` and `path` were declared and have never been sent. It also gains `startingGivens` (`EncodedGivenValues`), the name for a document's declared starting values.
- **A `versionId` request answers 501, not 500.** Every route that declares the parameter has documented `501 Not Implemented` all along, but `NotImplementedError` had no mapping and fell through to the 500 default.

### Migration

- Regenerate clients against `api-doc.yaml`. If your generator names `Givens`, that symbol becomes `GivenValues`, and the string-encoded form becomes `EncodedGivenValues`.
- `warnings[].target` becomes `warnings[].subject`.
- `RawNotebook.path` becomes `RawNotebook.modelPath`. `path` was declared but never populated, so anything reading it was already getting `undefined`; `modelPath` is the value it wanted.
- A caller that treated a `versionId` request's 500 as a server fault should expect 501.

## [0.0.242] — `PageViewer` is now `DataAppViewer`

The SDK component that embeds an in-package HTML data app is renamed, along with the docs page for the built-in web UI. No behavior changes.

### What changed

- **`PageViewer` → `DataAppViewer`**, exported from `components/DataAppViewer`. Props are unchanged (`resourceUri`). There is no alias, so an external consumer importing `PageViewer` will fail to build.
- **`utils/pageEmbed` → `utils/dataAppEmbed`**, same contents (`PUBLISHER_RESIZE_MESSAGE_TYPE`, `PublisherResizeMessage`, `isPublisherResizeMessage`, `serverBaseUrl`, `packageFileUrl`). The move itself is invisible to consumers: the module has no `./utils/*` subpath in `exports`, so it can only be reached through the package root, and the one symbol the root re-exports, `packageFileUrl`, keeps its name and its root export. Only the path behind it changed.
- **The package view's "Governed Reports" section is now labelled "Notebooks."** Label only; the same `.malloynb` files are listed, and no prop or route changed.
- **`docs/publisher-app.md` is now [docs/console.md](docs/console.md)**, and the built-in web UI is called the **Publisher Console** throughout the docs. The `packages/app` package name is unchanged.

### Migration

- Rename the import: `import { DataAppViewer } from "@malloy-publisher/sdk"`. That is the only change an embedder needs. `packageFileUrl` is the other symbol in this area reachable from the package root, and it is untouched.

The REST `/pages` endpoint is untouched by this change and still answers at its existing path. Renaming it to `/data-apps` is a separate, breaking change with its own release note.

## [0.0.242] — Breaking: `/pages` is now `/data-apps`

The endpoint that lists a package's in-package HTML data apps is renamed, along with its schema and the SPA route that opens one. **There is no alias and no deprecation period: a caller still requesting `/pages` stops getting the listing.**

A production deployment answers it **404 as JSON**, so a client sees a clean error rather than a surprise. That is worth stating because it was not true until recently: an unmatched path under `/api/v0/` used to fall through to the SPA's catch-all and answer 200 with `index.html` on any deployment serving the bundled web UI, which would have handed a migrating client an HTML body instead of an error. #962 fixed that catch-all. (Under `NODE_ENV=development` the JSON fallback is not mounted, so the same request gets an HTML 404 from Express instead.)

### What changed

- **`GET …/packages/{pkg}/pages` → `GET …/packages/{pkg}/data-apps`.** Same response shape, same query parameters, same status codes.
- **Schema `Page` → `DataApp`**, and the OpenAPI `operationId` `list-pages` → `list-data-apps` under a `data-apps` tag. Anything generated from `api-doc.yaml` changes accordingly: in the TypeScript client, `PagesApi.listPages` becomes `DataAppsApi.listDataApps`, and `apiClients.pages` on `<ServerProvider>`'s context becomes `apiClients.dataApps`.
- **The SPA route `/{env}/{pkg}/pages/{file}` → `/{env}/{pkg}/data-apps/{file}`, and the old form still works for one release.** A bookmark or shared link using `pages/` opens the data app as before and rewrites itself to the new URL in the address bar, carrying any query string or fragment with it so the rewrite never silently drops state a caller supplied. **This alias is deprecated and comes out one release after this one.** Update stored links now rather than relying on it. The standalone URL (`/environments/{env}/packages/{pkg}/{file}`) never changed. One thing the alias does take away: a model or notebook is excluded from the rewrite, so a `.malloy` or `.malloynb` living in a package's `pages/` directory still opens in the model viewer, but a non-model file under `public/pages/` is no longer reachable at `/{env}/{pkg}/pages/<file>` and is addressed as `/{env}/{pkg}/data-apps/pages/<file>` instead. That is the same collision described below for `public/data-apps/`, and nothing in this repo ships either directory.
- **The package view's "Pages" section is now labelled "Data Apps."**

### Migration

- Change the request path to `/data-apps`. If you generate a client from the spec, regenerate it.
- If you use the SDK's API clients directly, `apiClients.pages.listPages(env, pkg)` becomes `apiClients.dataApps.listDataApps(env, pkg)`.
- Update any stored link of the form `/{env}/{pkg}/pages/{file}`. It still works in this release and stops working in the next one.

Why the REST path breaks cleanly while the browser URL gets a grace period: the two have different costs and different owners. Carrying both spellings in the spec would mean two paths, two operationIds and two generated client methods for one listing, with every future change to it made twice, and the one known consumer of the endpoint reviewed this change and chose the clean break, having already accepted the short window during a rollout where some of its machines answer 404. A bookmark has no owner to consult, and the person who saved it is not reading these notes, so that surface redirects for one release rather than failing. The endpoint is documented (in [docs/html-data-apps.md](docs/html-data-apps.md) and [docs/api-overview.md](docs/api-overview.md), both updated here), so the REST break is a real one for anyone who took it up rather than a quiet one. If that trade is wrong for your deployment, say so on the PR.

One more consequence of the SPA route move, easy to miss: the app now claims the `data-apps` segment, so `/{env}/{pkg}/data-apps/<file>` is no longer redirected to the static route. Clicking a data app in the Console is unaffected, because the listing already includes the file's path relative to `public/`. What changes is a hand-written URL of that shape: it opens the embedded viewer one segment down, on `public/<file>`, rather than redirecting. A package that itself ships a `public/data-apps/` directory is the case to know about, since its files are addressed as `/{env}/{pkg}/data-apps/data-apps/<file>`; the standalone URL `/environments/{env}/packages/{pkg}/data-apps/<file>` serves them unchanged either way. This mirrors what `public/pages/` had before, so it is not a new class of collision, but `data-apps` is a likelier directory name than `pages` was.

## [0.0.249]: dashboards render, and the Console serves them

The server half of dashboards had no UI. It has one now: a package's dashboards are listed on its
page and open at `/{env}/{package}/dashboards/{name}`, and `<Dashboard>` is a public SDK export so an
embedding host renders the same component the Console does.

### What changed

- **A dashboard page.** `<Dashboard>` reads the manifest and renders either form: a single query
  whose result is the page, or a composite whose tiles each run on their own and combine into one
  `dashboardColumns` grid. A tile owning its own query is what lets one broken tile show its error in
  place while the rest of the grid still renders. It takes props rather than reading a router, so the
  Console and an external React app differ only in what they do with `onNavigate` and
  `onGivensChange`.
- **Control state is URL state.** Filtering replaces history so Back leaves the dashboard rather than
  walking through every value tried; a `to=<slug>` drill pushes it, so Back returns to the dashboard the
  drill started from. A `to=self` drill filters in place, so it takes the same replace as any other
  control change and Back leaves the dashboard rather than undoing the drill.
  A `# artifact { autorun=false }` dashboard batches changes behind Apply.
- **A Dashboards section on the package page**, listed first because it is the at-a-glance artifact a
  visitor most likely wants, and hidden when the package has none. A dashboard's own file is filtered
  out of Semantic Models so it is listed once; untagged shared includes under `dashboards/` are not
  dashboards and stay in the model list. Notebooks are now listed by title too, with the filename as
  the secondary label.
- **`## autorun=false` is honoured in notebooks**, which had hardcoded it true while nothing produced
  the field. The server derives it now, so a notebook gets the same Apply batching a dashboard does.
- **A `# drill` naming a dashboard navigates from a notebook cell**, which completes the primitive
  that shipped inert. Where a tag offers two destinations, the click opens a menu naming the
  dashboard and the current surface.
- **Drill is reachable without a mouse.** Marked cells take `role="button"`, focus is styled the way
  hover is, and Enter or Space activates. Previously the only signals a cell did anything were a
  pointer cursor and a hover colour, neither of which a keyboard or touch user can produce. A
  drillable column takes ONE tab stop rather than one per row, with ArrowUp/ArrowDown and Home/End
  moving within it: tabbing through every cell of a result would have been its own accessibility
  problem, since a result at the row cap would have stood between the reader and everything after
  it. The stop is per drillable COLUMN within a table, so a table grouping by two drilled dimensions
  carries two, and a drill inside a `nest:`, which the renderer draws as a table per parent row, still
  contributes one stop per parent row.
- **A `select` control looks like one.** MUI hides the dropdown arrow whenever a combobox accepts
  free text, which it must here since a `suggest` returns the common values rather than every legal
  one, so a picker rendered as a plain text box and its option list was undiscoverable.

### Two things to know when authoring

- **Write `given=` on a `# drill` tag whenever the dimension is not named after the given.**
  Without it the given is the dimension name exactly as the model spells it, so
  `dimension: brand_name` looks for a given called `brand_name` and a model declaring `BRAND` does
  not match: the cell still reads as clickable and the click lands on an unfiltered page. A
  difference of case alone is forgiven only for `to=self`, where the surface resolves the name
  against the givens it declares and folds case doing it. A `to=<slug>` drill does no lookup: the
  name goes into the destination's URL as the tag spells it and the destination binds only the
  parameters it declares, spelled identically, so `given=brand` into a dashboard declaring `BRAND`
  opens it unfiltered. A `to=self` drill seeding a given no model declares is reported at load.
- **A file that does not compile fails the whole package.** Loading aborts on the first model error,
  so the dashboards endpoint answers 424 and none of that package's dashboards are served, including
  the ones that compiled. A failed `?reload=true` is refused the same way and leaves the previously
  compiled package serving, which is the behaviour to rely on while editing.

One consequence of the new route, the same one the `data-apps` rename had: the app now claims the
`dashboards` segment, so `/{env}/{pkg}/dashboards/<file>` is no longer redirected to the static
route. It has to be claimed, because a slug is a filename with `.malloy` removed and
`dashboards/report.csv.malloy` therefore publishes the slug `report.csv`, which would otherwise be
diverted as an asset and 404 on a deep link or a refresh. The case to know about is a package that
itself ships a `public/dashboards/` directory. Unlike `data-apps`, there is no viewer one segment
down to catch those: `/{env}/{pkg}/dashboards/<file>` now opens the dashboard viewer, which reports
that the package has no dashboard by that name. Address them on the standalone URL,
`/environments/{env}/packages/{pkg}/dashboards/<file>`, which serves them unchanged as it always
did.

`docs/dashboards.md` is the guide. No bundled example ships a `dashboards/` directory yet; that
arrives with the examples change that follows this one.

## [0.0.249]: dashboards are discovered and served over REST

A `.malloy` file in a package's `dashboards/` directory carrying an `# artifact` tag is now discovered at load and served over two read-only endpoints. This is the server half only: there is no UI for it yet.

### What changed

- **Two new endpoints.** `GET …/packages/{packageName}/dashboards` lists a package's dashboards, and `GET …/packages/{packageName}/dashboards/{dashboardName}` returns one manifest: the artifact tag's declarations plus the control contract derived from the givens its query references, widened to the file's surfaced set when a tile is one discovery cannot resolve. New schemas `Dashboard`, `DashboardManifest`, and `DashboardTile`.
- **There is deliberately no run endpoint.** A dashboard's query, each composite tile, and each control's suggest query all run through the ordinary `POST …/models/{path}/query` with `givens`, using the manifest's `path` as the model, so row caps, byte caps, authorize gates, and render-tag validation all apply unchanged.
- **A dashboard whose entry file is not queryable is not listed.** When a package curates its query surface (`queryableSources: "declared"`), a dashboard whose entry file is not in `explores` is held back rather than published with a manifest whose every query and given name would 404, and the omission is reported in the package's `warnings`. Being listed is not always sufficient on its own: the queryable sources are the union of every listed file's `export {}` closure, so a tile reading a source that only an unlisted file exports is still refused, and the fix is to list that file too or re-export the source from one already listed.
- **Load-time lint.** Findings for a `# artifact` tag that does not parse or does not describe a dashboard, a tile or suggest query that does not resolve, an invalid grid width, and a `# drill` naming a destination that is not a dashboard, all on the existing non-fatal `Package.warnings` surface.
- **A notebook listing carries `title` and `description`,** resolved from its own `## title="…"`, then its `#"` doc comment, then its first markdown heading. `RawNotebook` gains `autorun`, the same flag with the same default that a dashboard's artifact tag carries.
- **`Notebook` declares `environmentName`,** which the response has always sent, and drops `resource`, which it declared and never sent (issue #979).

## [0.0.208] — Single-call materialization (plan-as-artifact)

**Breaking change to the materialization API.** Materialization moves from the two-round (compile-then-build) protocol to a single call. The build plan is now a compile-time property of the package, and a build is requested in one request.

### What changed

- **New `Package.buildPlan`.** `GET …/packages/{name}` (and every endpoint/MCP resource that returns package metadata) now includes a `buildPlan` describing the package's persist sources and their dependencies. It is `null` when the package has no persist sources. This is the artifact callers read to assemble build instructions.
- **Single-call builds via `buildInstructions`.** `POST …/materializations` accepts an optional `buildInstructions` body. With no instructions the publisher self-assigns names and runs the full build, auto-loading the resulting manifest (auto-run). With `buildInstructions` (validated against the live `Package.buildPlan` at create time) it builds directly into the caller-assigned names and does **not** auto-load — the caller distributes via `manifestLocation` (orchestrated).
- **Streamlined state machine.** `PENDING → MANIFEST_ROWS_READY → MANIFEST_FILE_READY` (terminal), or `FAILED` / `CANCELLED`. The transient `BUILD_PLAN_READY` status is removed.

### Removed (breaking)

- `pauseBetweenPhases` on `CreateMaterializationRequest`.
- The `BUILD_PLAN_READY` value from `MaterializationStatus`.
- `POST …/materializations/{id}?action=build` — `stop` is now the only supported action.
- `Materialization.buildPlan` — read the plan from `Package.buildPlan` instead.

### Client / UI impact

- **CLI:** the `--pause-between-phases` flag is gone; `malloy-pub materialize --wait` settles on `MANIFEST_FILE_READY` / `FAILED` / `CANCELLED`.
- **SDK UI:** the materialization detail dialog drops the "Mode" field and now renders its build-plan view from `Package.buildPlan`.
- Regenerate any SDK/Python/k6 clients against the updated `api-doc.yaml`.

## [0.0.229] — Package locations: `~/` expands, and relative paths anchor at the config

**A relative package `location` now resolves against the directory holding the config it appears in, not the server root.** Those are the same directory whenever the config is found at `<SERVER_ROOT>/publisher.config.json`, which covers the bundled samples, every Docker recipe in [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md), and any setup that `cd`s to the config before starting. Nothing changes for them. Two cases keep the server root as the anchor: the config bundled inside the published package (a zero-arg `npx @malloy-publisher/server`), and a `--config` naming a directory rather than a file.

**Who is affected:** anyone whose `--config <path>` names a file in a directory other than the server root, including a subdirectory of it, and whose packages use a relative `location`. Those packages previously resolved against the server root (the working directory, unless `--server_root` was also passed) and now resolve next to the config. Fix either way: make the `location` absolute, or move the config next to the packages it points at, which is the arrangement this change exists to support.

**The symptom is quiet.** A location that cannot be mounted is not fatal to the process: the server still reports `serving`. It does fail the whole environment the location belongs to, so that environment is skipped and none of its packages load, including the ones that resolved fine. The reason is in the log: `Error initializing environment "<name>"; skipping environment`.

**`~/` in a `location` now works.** It was accepted and then never expanded, so it resolved to a literal `~` directory under the server root and failed to mount. Expansion is unconditional and happens before any anchor applies.

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for the rule and the recommended layout.

## [0.0.205] — Source access gates (`#(authorize)`)

> **Syntax note (added later):** the string and file-level forms described here, and the OR semantics
> of stacked annotations, are all **retired and refused at model load** — see the dimension-form
> section at the top of this page for the current syntax.

**Sources can now gate query access on givens.** A `#(authorize) "<bool expr>"` annotation (source-level) or `##(authorize)` (file-level) is evaluated against the request's [givens](docs/givens.md) before any query that reads the source runs; access is denied with **HTTP 403** unless at least one in-scope expression is `true` (OR semantics). Enforced on `POST /…/query`, the notebook-cell `GET`, `POST /…/compile`, and the MCP `malloy_executeQuery` tool. Malformed or invalid annotations fail model load with **424**.

**Important — this is a trusted-tier boundary, not end-user authn.** Givens are caller-asserted, so `#(authorize)` enforces policy only when Publisher sits behind a trusted tier that sets givens from verified context and the query API is network-isolated from untrusted callers. See [docs/authorize.md](docs/authorize.md) (Security model) for the deployment contract, the locked-base + curated-extension pattern, and known limitations.

## [0.0.201] — Givens

**Givens are now the recommended way to supply runtime parameters.** Models declare `given:` blocks (per [Malloy's experimental givens feature](https://docs.malloydata.dev/documentation/experiments/givens)); callers send values via the new `givens` body field on `POST /…/query` and `POST /…/compile`, the `givens` query parameter on the notebook-cell GET, or the `givens` argument on the MCP `malloy_executeQuery` tool. The notebook UI automatically renders a Parameters panel for any model that declares givens.

`filterParams`, `bypassFilters`, the matching `filter_params` / `bypass_filters` query parameters, and `#(filter)` annotations are **deprecated** and will be removed in a future release after a coordinated migration with current users. Models that use `#(filter)` will continue to work unchanged during the deprecation window; affected responses now carry a `Deprecation: true` header (per RFC 8594) pointing at `docs/givens.md`, and the server logs a one-time migration notice when such a model is loaded. See [docs/givens.md](docs/givens.md) for the migration recipe.

> **This paragraph no longer describes current behaviour.** It was accurate at 0.0.201 and stopped being so when the notebook's Filters panel was removed: the notebook no longer sends `filterParams` at all. See "the notebook's controls are `given:` only" under **"[Unreleased]: shared given and drill controls, and the notebook adopts them"** for what a `#(filter)` model does now. Named rather than described by position: there are several unreleased sections and that one is not the topmost. The REST parameters themselves are untouched.

## [0.0.197] — SDK and app UI redesign

UI redesign of the SDK's pages and shell. Type-level public APIs are unchanged; rendered DOM, CSS, and visual treatment have changed across `Home`, `Project`, `Package`, `AddPackageDialog`, and the per-cell wrappers used by `Notebook` and `Model`. External embedders should review side-by-side before upgrading.

### Component visual changes

- **`<Home />`** — left-aligned hero, three feature columns (no icons, no chips), Credible-style project list. Same `onClickProject` prop.
- **`<Project />`** — h4 page title + "Packages" section heading, compact icon-tile cards (no underline, weight 600). Same `onSelectPackage`, `resourceUri` props.
- **`<Package />`** — replaces the 3-column grid (Config / Notebooks / Models / Databases / Connections) with a sectioned list (Governed Reports / Semantic Models / Package Data) plus a back link, h4 title, and inline README. Same `onClickPackageFile`, `resourceUri`, `retrievalFn` props. Subcomponents `Config`, `Connections`, `Databases`, `Models`, `Notebooks` under `components/Package/` are no longer rendered by `<Package>` (still importable; will be removed in a future release).
- **`<AddPackageDialog />`** — outlined text fields, pill buttons, refreshed copy. Same `resourceUri` prop.
- **`CleanMetricCard`** (used to wrap `<NotebookCell>` and `<ModelCell>` query results) — border, shadow, and white background removed; cells now flow without card chrome.
- **`<Notebook />` Filter Panel** — border + shadow removed.

### Theme token cleanup

- Replaced 16 hardcoded `color: "#666666"` instances across `Notebook`, `NotebookCell`, `Model`, `ModelCell`, `ResultsDialog`, and `ModelExplorerDialog` with `color: "text.secondary"`. Icons and section titles now follow the consumer's MUI theme.
- `PackageSectionTitle` (in `styles.ts`) refactored to read `theme.palette.text.secondary` and `theme.palette.divider`. Dropped uppercase + 0.5px letterspacing.

### App shell

- The top-bar `Header` in `packages/app` is replaced with a permanent left sidebar (260/64 collapse) + 56px content header with breadcrumb chips and a `#header-actions-portal` slot. Mobile navigation moves to a drawer.
- Theme: black/off-white palette, Inter + JetBrains Mono fonts (loaded from Google Fonts), pill button shape (20px radius), 4px card radius. ABC Diatype (paid commercial) is not used.
- MUI's click ripple animation is disabled globally via `MuiButtonBase` defaultProps (deliberate, matches the flat button aesthetic). Affects only consumers wrapped by Publisher's exported `theme` (i.e. `<MalloyPublisherApp />` users); embedders rendering individual SDK components inside their own `<ThemeProvider>` keep their own ripple defaults.
- Package-detail icon tiles use Malloy brand colors sampled from `public/logo.svg`: teal `#14b3cb` (reports), orange `#e47404` (models), dark blue `#1474a4` (data).

### New internal surface

- `Package/ContentTypeIcon.tsx` — inline-SVG icon component (`type: "report" | "model" | "data"`) for branded tiles. Not exported from the package root.

### Migration

- If you embed `<Notebook>` or `<Model>` and rely on the bordered card around each result, you'll need to add your own wrapper.
- If you provide a custom MUI theme, verify `palette.text.secondary` is defined — it now drives muted icon and text colors that were previously hardcoded.
- The `MalloyPublisherApp({ headerProps })` API is unchanged at the type level (`logoHeader?: ReactElement`, `endCap?: ReactElement`), but the slots render in different DOM positions with different size constraints than they did in 0.0.x:
  - **`logoHeader`** previously rendered on the left of a horizontal top bar. It now renders in the **sidebar header** (56 px tall, 260 px wide expanded, 64 px wide collapsed). Wide horizontal wordmarks designed for a top bar may crop or disappear in the collapsed sidebar — prefer a compact mark + short label, or an icon that reads alone at 64 px.
  - **`endCap`** previously rendered on the right of the top bar next to the doc links. It now renders into the **content header portal** (right-aligned slot in a 56 px content header above the page content). The portal is global across routes, so it's intended for cross-route primary actions (e.g. a sign-in or settings button), not per-page actions.
- The `app` package now declares `@tanstack/react-query` as a direct dependency. Consumers who rely on hoisting from the SDK's peerDep are unaffected; consumers installing `app` standalone will now resolve the dependency cleanly.
