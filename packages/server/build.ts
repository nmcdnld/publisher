// load-bearing for the shipped image, not a convenience.
//
// The SPA is built by a separate step, which `build:server-only` does not run.
// That does NOT mean its callers don't need the UI: the Dockerfile builds the
// app in its own cache layer and then relies on this copy to place it. Absent a
// bundle we therefore fail loudly by default, so an app build that stops
// happening breaks the build instead of quietly publishing a UI-less server.
//
// SKIP_APP_BUNDLE only declares that absence is acceptable — the harness builds
// on checkouts with no SPA and drives the REST API. Note the flag does not
// suppress the copy: `dist` is wiped above, so skipping whenever it was merely
// requested would strip an already-built SPA out of an existing bundle and leave
// the next `bun run start` serving a UI that 404s for no visible reason.
