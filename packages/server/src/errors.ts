// Client-facing body for an internal failure (500/502). The specific error
// message can carry internal detail -- a filesystem path, an SQL fragment, an
// upstream host -- so it is logged server-side (below) and NOT returned.
//
// Generalizing is decided per branch, not by status class -- 501, 503 and 504
// are 5xx and still return their messages. Every 4xx returns its message
// because a client error names what the caller must change. The 5xx branches
// that return theirs do so because the message is one this server composed (a
// missing feature, a cap that was reached, a timeout), which is true of most of
// them but not all: the worker-pool and compile-worker throws behind 503
// interpolate the underlying failure, so a crash message reaches the caller
// there. An unusable publisher.json does not land in that branch: it throws
// PackageManifestError, which the pool's wire shape carries by class, so it
// maps to 424 below instead of reading as a worker outage.
//
// So a NEW 5xx branch is a decision rather than a default: generalize it here
// if its message comes from a driver, a worker, or the filesystem.
//
// Neither generic body carries a correlation handle, which is what a user
// reporting "I got Internal server error." would hand an operator to find the
// logged detail. That is deliberately unchanged rather than overlooked: no error
// response in this server has ever carried one (the `details` field the Error
// schema declares is populated nowhere, and the MCP JSON-RPC path answers with a
// bare "Internal server error" too), so adding one only here would make this the
// single exception rather than the new convention. Worth doing server-wide --
// `loggerMiddleware` already derives a W3C traceId when the caller sends
// `traceparent`, and it would go in `details` with no schema change -- but it is
// its own change, and it wants an id that exists for callers who send no
// traceparent.

 * statement, bounded only by the request body limit. With a stack appended that
 * is multi-KB per failure, and a log sink with a max line size drops the largest

 * Log an internal failure's detail server-side, in the one place the response
 * stops carrying it.
 *
 * The fields are copied out explicitly rather than passing the Error itself:
 * `message` and `stack` are non-enumerable own properties, so
 * `logger.error(msg, { error })` on an actual Error serializes to
 * `{"error":{}}` under both formats this server configures -- the detail would
 * exist nowhere at all. Copying the fields is also what lets the guards below
 * apply to them.
 *
 * They are nested under `error` rather than spread at the top level because
 * `message` is winston's own reserved key: a top-level `message` is fused into
 * `info.message`, so the summary becomes "<summary> <the whole driver error>".
 * That makes the summary unique per failure -- unusable as a grouping key or an
 * alert condition -- and leaves no queryable field holding just the error text.
 * Nesting keeps the summary stable and puts the detail at `error.message`. This
 * is not the `{ error }` bug above returning: these are plain strings, so
 * nothing depends on non-enumerable properties.
 *
 * Newlines and other control characters are stripped because the default format
 * (colorize + simple, whenever OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT is unset) is
 * newline-delimited plain text, so a message carrying `\n` -- and caller SQL can
 * -- could otherwise forge log entries. The range also covers the separators
 * JSON.stringify does NOT escape (NEL, and the U+2028/U+2029 line and paragraph
 * separators): those reach the rendered line verbatim under both formats, so
 * `format.json()` is not a backstop for them the way it is for `\n`.
 *
 * `level` separates the two cases that reach here, because they mean different
 * things to whoever is watching. An unrecognized error is a bug in this server
 * and belongs at `error`. An upstream connection failure is usually the
 * caller's or the warehouse's, and a caller can drive it in a loop with bad
 * SQL, so logging it at `error` lets one client fill the error log and move an
 * error-rate dashboard meant to track our own faults. It goes to `warn`.

 * large; the distinction exists so callers are not told to raise a cap. Raising
 * `PUBLISHER_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` cannot help here, because there is no cap at
 * which a response that will not serialize starts serializing, so the only
 * remedies are the ones that shrink the response.

 * upstream caller did nothing wrong, but the downstream query took
