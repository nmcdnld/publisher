# Publisher documentation

> Start at the [project README](../README.md) for the 60-second quick start. This folder holds the
> deeper reference. If you're an AI agent, read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) first — it's the canonical
> guide to running Publisher and connecting over MCP.
>
> Publisher is created and maintained by [Credible](https://www.credibledata.com), the company
> behind the AI Analytics Engine. For where the open-source engine ends and Credible's hosted engine
> begins, see [credibledata.com/malloy](https://www.credibledata.com/malloy).

## Examples

Three runnable packages ship in the default `examples` environment, plus one standalone React app —
every doc below points back to one of them, and each example's README points back to the docs.

| Example                                              | What it shows                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [storefront](../examples/storefront)                 | A complete ecommerce model — joins, measures, `# dashboard` views, and a no-build HTML app. The flagship first-open package.      |
| [governed-analytics](../examples/governed-analytics) | Givens, `#(access_filter)`, row-level access, and discovery curation in one small package.                                            |
| [html-data-app](../examples/html-data-app)           | A no-build SaaS-subscriptions dashboard served from a package's `public/` directory.                                              |
| [data-app](../examples/data-app)                     | _Advanced/internal:_ a standalone React app built on the SDK, reading from `storefront`. Not a served package — run it with Vite. |

## Concepts

| Doc                                | Read it when you want to…                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | Understand how Malloy, Render, Publisher, and the SDK fit together.                                      |
| [api-overview.md](api-overview.md) | Understand the REST + MCP surfaces and the resource hierarchy.                                           |
| [packages.md](packages.md)         | Understand the package format: `publisher.json`, models, data files, and how a package gets served.      |
| [scaffolding.md](scaffolding.md)   | Scaffold a package with `npm create` — the `@latest` rule, the workspace it writes, seeding from a file. |
| [dbt-roadmap.md](dbt-roadmap.md)   | See how Malloy and dbt fit together, where the gaps are, and the plan to close them.                     |

## Use it

| Doc                                            | Read it when you want to…                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [console.md](console.md)                       | Navigate the Publisher Console, the built-in web UI, and see how constructs surface.                 |
| [explorer.md](explorer.md)                     | Build queries with the no-code visual query builder.                                                 |
| [choosing-a-surface.md](choosing-a-surface.md) | Pick between a notebook, a dashboard, and an HTML data app.                                          |
| [dashboards.md](dashboards.md)                 | Build a dashboard by dragging tiles in the Console, or write the `dashboards/*.malloy` file by hand. |
| [ai-agents.md](ai-agents.md)                   | Connect an AI agent, over MCP or (unattended) over REST, and ground it in your models.               |
| [html-data-apps.md](html-data-apps.md)         | Ship a no-build HTML dashboard **inside a package**, hosted by Publisher.                            |
| [embedded-data-apps.md](embedded-data-apps.md) | _Advanced/internal:_ the React SDK the Console is built from.                                        |

## Model & govern

**Runtime parameters and access control all build on one mechanism — [givens](givens.md).** Start
there for the primitive, then follow the application you need.

| Doc                                                | Read it when you want to…                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [givens.md](givens.md)                             | Learn the base mechanism — declare runtime parameters, drive filter widgets, and reach access control. |
| [row-level-access.md](row-level-access.md)         | Restrict _which rows_ a caller sees (given-scoped `where:` + `#(access_filter)`).                          |
| [authorize.md](authorize.md)                       | Gate _who_ can query a source, and _which rows_ they get, with `#(access_filter)`.                         |
| [discovery-and-access.md](discovery-and-access.md) | Control _what_ is discoverable and queryable (`index.malloy`) — the visibility axis.                 |
| [security-posture.md](security-posture.md)         | Understand what Publisher does and does not defend against, before deploying it or adding a feature.   |

| [materialization.md](materialization.md)                   | Persist Malloy sources into tables — the publish-gate rules, on-demand + scheduled builds, the `malloy-pub` CLI, and standalone-vs-hosted behavior.                                                      |
| [preaggregation.md](preaggregation.md)                     | Roll a measure up to a coarse grain with `#@ preaggregate` so covered queries read a small table — what can be pre-aggregated, what routes, and what it costs.                                           |
| [query-metadata.md](query-metadata.md)                     | Tag the statements Publisher sends so the backend's own reporting can attribute them — layers, the contract, and correlating an API call with a backend query. Off unless `PUBLISHER_QUERY_METADATA=on`. |
| [ducklake.md](ducklake.md)                                 | Attach a DuckLake catalog (read-only), understand catalog-format compatibility, and run offline / air-gapped.                                                                                            |
| [persist-storage-tutorial.md](persist-storage-tutorial.md) | Materialize a `#@ persist` source into a DuckLake storage destination and serve queries from it (the `storage=` tier + the `PERSIST_STORAGE_MODE` switch).                                               |

| [configuration.md](configuration.md)                       | Look up an env var / CLI flag, or tune the OOM guards.                                                                                                                                                   |
